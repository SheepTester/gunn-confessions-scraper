I\u2019ll also be including other genres for anyone else interested :)\nFor the sake of non being repetitive, I\u2019m not going to mention the big ones, like Black Clover, My Hero Academia, Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, Demon Slayer, etc. Those have probably been mentioned as some point or another.\nIf you want a summary of any of these anime, go to My Anime List and look them up.\nWith that being said, anime list!\nOverlord \u2014 this one\u2019s kinda similar to One Punch Man in the sense that it\u2019s a satire of OP characters. It also just generally has really interesting and unique characters.\nGenre: Action, Comedy, Isekai, Fantasy\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime \u2014 also has a diversity of characters and an OP main character. And his slime form is really cute.\nGenre: Action, Comedy, Fantasy, Isekai\nAssassination Classroom \u2014 less about action and a lot more about how classmates interact with each other and their teachers. Even still, Koro-Sensei is really OP and so is Nagisa to some extent.\nGenre: Comedy, Action, School\nAkatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn) \u2014 it\u2019s an action... with a female lead! This one\u2019s another one of my favorites, and I highly recommend watching this one.\nGenre: Historic, Adventure, Action\nNow some romance ones:\nLove is War \u2014 really cute. Highly recommend. Everyone is so loveable in this anime, even that one guy that\u2019s gloomy all the time. It\u2019s basically one giant satire of romance (pay attention to the narrator).\nGenre: Romance, School, Comedy\nYour Lie in April \u2014 a nice romance complete with music! Character development is really apparent and fun to see. Also the music is really good :P\nGenre: Music, Romance, School, Drama\nAcchi Kocchi \u2014 personally, I really love this one. Everyone is super cute, and there\u2019s not much drama involved: it\u2019s basically purely warm and fuzzy moments.\nGenre: Romance, Comedy, Slice of Life\nI\u2019ll do some more later if more people want it haha.\n[#GunnConfessions9610]\n#GunnConfessions9621",

    "content": "9620. [2021] pass/fail literally sucks and I think we really need to band together and talk to the Gunn admin because there ARE better solutions. Please hear me out; foothill and most other colleges have a similar system to what we are doing now except they have options, students can choose to have pass/fail or receive an actual letter grade when taking a course and we should have the same system and let students choose. Pass:fail should still be an option because some people need it, if they can\u2019t complete as much work because their family is sick or etc... but for the rest of us, having this semester of grades matters and we would rather not have pass/fail.\nit works for about half of Gunn students, aka the seniors who are chilling in second semester and don\u2019t need grades, and the freshman who\u2019s grades don\u2019t even matter for UCs. For the rest of us, it\u2019s a whole semester of grades that can boost your GPA missing; especially those of us who were counting on having this semester to boost it and chose our courses based on this fact.\nFor sophomores, now they have to get great grades in junior year when they will be taking APS and much harder classes because they don\u2019t have the cushion of sophomore year grades to back them up. This is extremely unfair because they will suffer much more stress in junior year, when the majority are taking the SAT, starting to think about college, and have difficult classes.\nFor juniors, this was their last chance to boost their GPA and get good grades and that\u2019s been unfairly taken away from them. The hard classes you took that would have affected your weighted GPA now do not and you basically took it for nothing. A whole semester is gone from the grade book.\nSome may say that \u2018a semester doesn\u2019t make a difference\u2019 and \u2018colleges will overlook it\u2019 but it puts us at a great a disadvantage compared to other students from other schools who are NOT doing pass/fail, (and the majority are not) and will have these grades when they are applying for college.\nLets step it up and convince the admin or at least do something.\n#GunnConfessions9620",

A lack of structured curriculum, test preparation, and varying circumstances with home life means that grades would be very unlikely to go up, but rather more likely to go down.

    "content": "9574. @9556, i\u2019m the person who posted the og post and, lemme tell you, if your looking for preventative measures you shouldn\u2019t be looking to trump and america for an example because he sure did not do anything except pretend that it was going away for nearly 3 weeks before even recognizing it as an actual problem that he should be dealing with instead of trying to silence it. he actually told people that it was ok go to work even if they were sick, and that the virus was completely contained even tho that was NOWHERE near true. Now i\u2019m not saying that China did everything right, of course not, they also covered things up and ignored the problem at the beginnng. However, they did eventually pull it together and built 16 hospitals to treat people, the last of which just closed because they\u2019ve actually CONTAINED THE VIRUS. Look at South Korea, they\u2019ve got a less than 1% mortality rate because they took full preventative measures. So don\u2019t come lecturing me that I need to \u201ctoughen up\u201d or whatever the fuck because what definitely doesn\u2019t help an issue like this is people blaming a literal natural occurrence of a virus on an entire race of people. there have been a significant increase of hate crimes against asian people since the virus began, and it\u2019s not a coincidence. Yes, a lot of Chinese in the area support trump. that doesn\u2019t negate the people who have been unfairly discriminated against and hurt because of the ignorant, racist people who can\u2019t understand that they shouldn\u2019t be blaming people, they should just shut up and stay inside so it stops spreading. So I\u2019m sorry you are having a hard time facing the facts, but there it is. Racists are using this as an excuse to inact their prejudice against people who have done nothing wrong.\n[#GunnConfessions9556]\n#GunnConfessions9574",

    "content": "9573. [2020] A few weeks ago, before quarantine, I was really considering killing myself if school got canceled. (I won\u2019t) But I just never actually thought we\u2019d get here. As someone who uses school as a distraction from my home life, this isn\u2019t just about me missing out on prom or seeing Romeo and Juliet or possibly graduating, but trust me I feel each of those losses too. It\u2019s about every mental aspect of school; having a purpose to my day is so incredibly important. Having a reason to get ready in the morning, to like how I look. Seeing people in classes I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call my friend, but I could make a silly joke to every now and then, that\u2019s gone. I want to be learning. But I\u2019ve barely had the intrinsic motivation to live the past few years, much less do flexible online learning.\nOutside of that, I could and have called my friends, but I know both that my mood won\u2019t do them any good, and that I wouldn\u2019t want to see them being productive if it meant leaving me in the dust. That\u2019s an incredibly selfish way to put that and I wish I could change it. But. Also, what would we talk about besides what\u2019s happening in the world right now? Every moment I\u2019m awake, I spend thinking about how next I\u2019m going to get food to feed my family, how we\u2019ll stretch the money I\u2019m not making right now, how to make my mom see the sunlight for once, have some light exposure therapy. How I can\u2019t tell anyone because my problems don\u2019t compare to the fact that they\u2019re \u201cmissing prom.\u201d I\u2019m living day to day. And I don\u2019t really need the advice of my friends, lovely as they are, sitting in their kushy homes, complaining about everything that got taken away from them.\nThis week I got accepted to my top school. I haven\u2019t told anyone. I\u2019m immunocompromised and I completely understand the value of flattening the curve. But I\u2019m in a valley. A violent drop from the content, king-of-the-hill living that was the beginning of my senior year. And I can\u2019t fucking wait for it to go back up.\n#GunnConfessions9573",

I think we all are upset about the circumstances of this event, but protecting the health of everyone is more important than prom. School isn\u2019t being canceled because education is one of the biggest priorities of gunn. We come to school to be educated and to learn. It would also prolong graduation which would stuck. Yes it sucks that all these awesome trips are being canceled, but this is absolutely ridiculous. The amount of disrespect is insane. I think we all just need to calm down because it\u2019s making it worse\n#GunnConfessions9410",

As the corona virus case increases, the number of racist actions towards Asians are increasing as well. I saw too many videos of asians just getting humiliated in public, people shouting racial slurs to asians, and committing violence to them. I have experienced quite similar stuff in the local grocery store and I feel absolutely disgusted and horrible. It made me sick. Please. Share this issue with a lot of people and the mainstream media is not doing a good job of covering this issue. We can at least discuss about it and make it more prominent. I really hope no one, not only Asians, get humiliated like this. I\u2019m sorry if this post was mostly about racism against Asians, but this corona virus panic and using those \u201cfear\u201d justification is becoming insane. The number of attempted violence and public harassment is increasing by days and it is extremely sad to see that not many people are aware of this or even considering the fact that there are people out there being treated like trash. It is absolutely upsetting. I really wanted to address this issue as I want this to stop occurring. Thank you for reading this long post and I really hope you check out this link: https://twitter.com/KALONSMERALDO/status/1235429090745896960?s=20\n^warning: It contains violence. If this triggers you, please don\u2019t see. But I really hope many people take a look.\n#GunnConfessions9393",

[2020] Unpopular opinion: people are against homosexuality because of their religion should not be attacked.\nImagine this:\nYou identify with a certain religion, which may have a holy book. You align your moral code with this book, read it constantly, live by it. You put your faith in this religion, the community that has supported you for years, and this sacred book. Faced with the most difficult decisions, the most difficult topics, you turn to religion to guide you. And is LGBTQ+ a [~~relatively~~] new topic? Yes. So you listen to your religious leaders, meditate over this book.\nI guess I'm trying to say that if you put 100% of your faith into a religion, would you choose unconditional acceptance or your religion? If you choose unconditional acceptance, then did you really put all of your faith into this religion? But if you choose your religion, then what happens to unconditional acceptance?\nI am not at all saying that it is okay to use religion as an excuse to be prejudiced or to discriminate. I am saying that if any of us were religious people, perhaps our choice to accept homosexuality is at odds with our choice to follow our religion--a very difficult choice indeed.\nWould love to hear opposing arguments.\n#GunnConfessions9391",

    "content": "9248. [2020] @4238 Thought this should be posted again for the Juniors since caaspp testing is coming up soon\nRegarding the CAASPP:\nAlmost all mentioned positives are either lies or half-truths.\nFunding: Gunn does not qualify nor has ever qualified for Title I funding, the only funding affected by standardized testing participation as implemented by No Child Left Behind and the succeeding ESSA (>35% low income students). The district encouraging students to take the CAASPP is due to pressuring from the state Education Department since there is a chance that a state would lose federal funding for poor schools receiving Title I funding if they drop below 95% statewide participation. However, plenty of states have dropped to even as low as 80% and none have ever lost federal funds. There is state money associated with participation that may only be spent to negate the cost of the CAASPP. The SAO shutting down in the morning was based on divergence of funds for other purposes (Title IX oopsie) as evidenced by the PAUSD budget sheet for 2019.\nSchool Rating:\nAs mentioned before, Gunn already has a very high score based on CAASPP results even from years with low participation. Interestingly, the year participation grew from 25% to 65%, test scores dropped from an average 97.91 to 94.8.\nAccreditation:\nThere is no evidence to suggest that a high school has ever been unaccredited solely because of low state testing participation.\nCollege:\nCAASPP results only allow you to avoid work for California State Universities (CSU's, NOT UC's) introductory courses, most of which can be skipped by senior or junior classes at Gunn.\nCAASPP scores do not affect the admission process for either CSU's or UC'S, only the aforementioned skipping introductory courses for CSU's. The state did propose adding scores to admission for UC's in 2018 but the UC board of regents concluded that CAASPP scores have no correlation with student merit and would take 5-6 years to study and come to a decision.\nAlmost all colleges do not look at the Seal of Biliteracy or the Golden State Seal of Honor as other states do not have equivalents.\nRaffle: Ok this one is valid but beware since some seniors have reported not receiving their prizes from last year.\nAt the end of the day, it's your own prerogative whether you want to spend 8 hours for the CAASPP, but just be aware of the costs and benefits of your choice.\n#GunnConfessions9248",

So I said, politely, and this is a quote of what I said, \u201cExcuse me, sir, would you mind turning the music down?\u201d And first he said \u201cI\u2019m deaf, if you don\u2019t like it, you leave. Leave.\u201d This was said super rudely. I guess this is where I could have reacted by saying something like \u201csorry\u201d, and turned away. But I was very confused by the tone of this man, and kinda dumbstruck. Then he started yelling, \u201cDo you have ID? Let me see ID\u201d. And \u201cI\u2019m the master here\u201d. And he kept shouting those two things. And then the entire coffee shop was looking, and people tried to intervene but that somehow made it worse. I don\u2019t know. Tell me that he would have still felt like he could yell at me if I weren\u2019t a young woman. I get that, unlike last time, this isn\u2019t a big deal, and that this might not even be related to gender, but oh my god all I want to do is sit in a coffee shop and work is that too much to ask for??\n#GunnConfessions9105",

    "content": "9044. [Important Message for Valentine\u2019s Day ] This is super controversial and people are likely gonna be super mad at me for saying this but I feel like it needs to be said.\nWith Valentine\u2019s Day coming up some of you need to stop being so thirsty. You don\u2019t need a relationship to be happy and thinking that you do will make you more depressed. A lot of people get into relationships when they\u2019re not socially, emotionally, or physically ready for one and it will hurt them in the long run.\nIf you\u2019re attractive (if someone has confessed feelings for you ever in your life you\u2019re attractive) or even an average looking girl then it may be easy for you to find someone on Valentine\u2019s Day. Just because you could be in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean that you should. You might not be socially or emotionally mature enough for one, and it might make sense to wait even if you don\u2019t want to at this moment. I\u2019ve seen so many friends and classmates go through terrible relationships because they were incompatible but both very attractive. I\u2019ve seen friends who date or fuck in an attempt to remove some form of trauma. You need to learn that dating isn\u2019t going to solve your emotional or social problems. Being in a romantic or sexual relationship won\u2019t necessarily make you happier in the long run, and if you\u2019re not mature enough it could actually make you very depressed when you get dumped or have to break up with someone. Other people can help, but only you can make yourself happy.\nIf you\u2019re ugly, you need the face that reality and understand that life isn\u2019t fair. People can and do judge you based on your looks first and your personality second. You can\u2019t control your race, the size of certain body parts, or your height. You can\u2019t change society\u2019s perception or expectations of beauty. You can\u2019t expect someone else to like you. You do not \u201cdeserve\u201d romantic love. And you might never find love, but you can still find happiness. Learn to take care of yourself and be happy with who you are. Find out what you like to do and go do it. Figure out what your personality is and how you want to live your life. This will make you happy with who you are, and it\u2019ll give you a way to be happy while you\u2019re alone. Once you actually have a personality, find people who have similar personalities, hobbies, and interests. Spend time with them and make new friends. Only when you reach this stage will you be socially and emotionally ready for a relationship. Granted, society is fucked up and you might not ever get a chance, but suck it up buttercup, life isn\u2019t fair. You can still be happy with your friends and hobbies which is why it\u2019s so important for you to learn to be happy alone and with friends before even trying to get into a relationship.\nIf you\u2019re struggling alone right now and you feel ugly and unwanted, I get it. I\u2019ve been there. I know you might desperately want a relationship. But the solution isn\u2019t trying to run when you haven\u2019t even learned to crawl.\nIt took me a long time to understand this but now that I do I\u2019m much happier with my life. No I\u2019m still not dating anyone, but I am very content with myself and my friends now. And I think that\u2019s far more important than any potential relationship I\u2019ll ever be in.\n#GunnConfessions9044",

I didn't want to post it because it made me feel so disgusted, but I still wanted to speak out on it. You have no right to make those comments about my body, to objectify me in such a vulgar manner. You have no right to speak about me like that; focusing on my physical appearance instead of my personality. My boyfriend is lucky to have me because of who I am, not how I look. Females are still being described of as their physical appearance when they are so much more.\nYour confessions made me feel so violated and disgusted with myself. I felt watched and considering it's Sunday when you wrote that, I know it wasn't because you had just seen me at school. I hope you know how horrible you made me feel and how frustrating it is as a female to have to still deal with this. Please change your behavior, stop objectifying women, and never look at me again, thanks.\n#GunnConfessions9036",

On the other hand, if I don't do stuff and am not productive, I get anxious or depressed. I feel like life is innately miserable, or at best mediocre.\n#GunnConfessions9032",

I've written a letter to Cathy Lawrence already, but I just wanted to spread the word about what you can do to hopefully fix this. If you look at page 56 of the student handbook (link: https://gunn.pausd.org/sites/default/files/gunn_handbook_19-20.pdf), Gunn has endorsed the \"InsideOut\" Initiative regarding sports on campus.\nAmong other things, the initiative states that \"The program emphasizes a transformational relationship between coaches and athletes rather than\na 'win at all costs' transactional relationship.\"\nAfter seeing the emails and hearing the complaints myself, it is clear that Coach Granville is in violation of this initiative. If you really want to get involved, spread the word, and tell your friends and your parents (admin will do something if parents get involved!) to email admin about your concerns. Good luck guys, track was one of my favorite parts ab Gunn and it sucks to see this happen.\nSincerely,\na pissed off alumni\n#GunnConfessions9010",

How does he expect us to improve if he doesn\u2019t let us practice. He also yells at students who are injured for missing practice (going to the trainer instead of getting more injured), and had lost his temper in front of students when yelling at Curtis multiple times.

[2021] You can bet I've never experienced racism, but surely you can understand that to somebody who was born way after slavery was abolished, all I work with is what I experience, and what I experience is the media and apparently you saying meh, racism against white people is moderately okay because those poor black people (#emotional) suffered so much and still suffer sometimes today. I don't find it fair that I am associated to ill intent because of something that happened 155 years ago, way before I was born, because of the color of my skin. I am not responsible for what happened back then, and the law has COMPLETLY fixed this. Don't give me that bullshit that \"yeah but the feeling still lingers and you wouldn't understand if you were black\", because that's a problem with a select few people being assholes, not a systematic problem. The only time when that lingering toxicity excuse would have been relevant would be ~60 years ago when some people who owned slaves might still have been alive. Black people have the exact same rights as white people, and the liberal media likes to focus on the cases when a black person was oppressed modern day at the hands of an unlawful officer or something like that when the fact of the matter is that that officer does not represent the white race, and it does not happen as often as the liberals make you want to think.\nI am fully aware that what happened 155 years ago and the cases of racism that still occur today are terrible, but it was the individual who was racist, not the race. Your mindset now is the exact same reason some people today associate black people with crime and drugs, because some large cases happened to have a black person involved, and the stupid human race likes to generalize and say oh that guy represents the whole race. This. mindset. is. fucking. racist! (and it goes both ways!)\nI am not saying racism isn't a problem still today, but it isn't because of slavery or history, its because some people are just assholes, and that happens all the time and is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things",

Additionally, the email never specified which part of your body needs to be covered by the bra. So you can show off your nipples too if you wear the bra on your head or arm or something.\n[8966. [Gunn T&F] Last track season I had one of the best times of my life being able to compete in ccs as a sophomore was awesome all the pressure and adrenaline rush was great. Its only been 3 days into the new season. The numbers of sprinters we has dropped. We have no varsity girl sprinters and Im fairly sure we just lost the last two varsity boys sprinters. One being the most dedicated man I have ever known. He's willing to train 7 hours just to get a good practice in. Which is far beyond what CCS regulation allows. Most of the OG sprinters left for hurdles or jumps and its all cause of Granville. I dont think anyone else who wasn\u2019t in track/xc will ever be able to understand what\u2019s happening hence why the admin hasn't done anything. More than half the varsity time have complained about him and his training methods. Im already injured and its because of his over training. I was hoping for an even better season sub 50 in the 400 and go to states in the 4x4, but thats gone. I dont really have anything else besides track. But Im willing to quit entirely or just join paly or lahs track. Anything to get me a good season. Ive tried multiple times to get Granville to lessen the workouts. He's been over training our fast twitch muscles (muscles used for sprinting) which has caused great fatigue to set in. We had to run a 500x2 (1 1/4 lap) at 65 seconds per. This doesn't seem like anything but anyone who\u2019s reading this can\u2019t go sub 75. After we ran that, we were supposed to do these weird walking lunge drills and wickets (running over small hurdles to better your form). Then we had to do 3 point stands which no one could do and then we did normal block starts. Leaving just me to teach people how to properly start. Im notorious for having the worst start ever. But Granville being the \u201cGOAT\u201d left me to help people. He instead did some random sign in thing that we have to do. Which would bring me to the new rules. We have to sign in and out which uses up 30 minutes just to sign in and then another 30 to sign out. So an hour in total to make sure people come. We have to warm up on the field which is where throws happen to practice and Im not sure when but I know someone will be hit by a discus someday which could potentially kill them cause thats what happens when a 3lbs disc is flying at 20+mph slams into your head. We also have a rule where if you can come to 4/5 of the practices you basically just shouldn't come. My friend he has to miss a few days a week but is willing to make them up over the weekend taking No one else's but his time to run. But of course Granville says he should just quit. Mind you he\u2019s been running track since middle school. A little fun stupid rule we have is we can\u2019t run with our shirts off (guys) or in sports bras (girls). Which is so incredibly stupid cause when it hits 80 degrees + and we just ran our arses off and have a few more reps to go those shirts are going off. Its also just a runners pride thing to do build up a sweat enough to get those runners abs to glisten and then show off to the world. The last thing would be captains. Granville threatened the upper class men by saying \u201ccaptain positions, are available for anyone who appears to be a leader, this could mean a freshmen could be a captain.\u201d Some of y'all will probably be well just step up then. Heres the thing if we do then we suck up to Granville boosting his already peaked in high school \u201cGOAT\u201d ego but on the plus we get to be captain. Or we could do nothing have a freshmen who doesn\u2019t understand anything be a captain. The complete final rule was to not question his training styles/methods or anything in general. Even though we already have injured team mates, terrible workouts and horrible communication throughout the team. This may not seem strict but the track team is built on preppies (people who do it for the prep) and w/o them, we pretty much have no team. I\u2019m just kinda done with track now so I guess I quit.]",

    "content": "8966. [Gunn T&F] Last track season I had one of the best times of my life being able to compete in ccs as a sophomore was awesome all the pressure and adrenaline rush was great. Its only been 3 days into the new season. The numbers of sprinters we has dropped. We have no varsity girl sprinters and Im fairly sure we just lost the last two varsity boys sprinters. One being the most dedicated man I have ever known. He's willing to train 7 hours just to get a good practice in. Which is far beyond what CCS regulation allows. Most of the OG sprinters left for hurdles or jumps and its all cause of Granville. I dont think anyone else who wasn\u2019t in track/xc will ever be able to understand what\u2019s happening hence why the admin hasn't done anything. More than half the varsity time have complained about him and his training methods. Im already injured and its because of his over training. I was hoping for an even better season sub 50 in the 400 and go to states in the 4x4, but thats gone. I dont really have anything else besides track. But Im willing to quit entirely or just join paly or lahs track. Anything to get me a good season. Ive tried multiple times to get Granville to lessen the workouts. He's been over training our fast twitch muscles (muscles used for sprinting) which has caused great fatigue to set in. We had to run a 500x2 (1 1/4 lap) at 65 seconds per. This doesn't seem like anything but anyone who\u2019s reading this can\u2019t go sub 75. After we ran that, we were supposed to do these weird walking lunge drills and wickets (running over small hurdles to better your form). Then we had to do 3 point stands which no one could do and then we did normal block starts. Leaving just me to teach people how to properly start. Im notorious for having the worst start ever. But Granville being the \u201cGOAT\u201d left me to help people. He instead did some random sign in thing that we have to do. Which would bring me to the new rules. We have to sign in and out which uses up 30 minutes just to sign in and then another 30 to sign out. So an hour in total to make sure people come. We have to warm up on the field which is where throws happen to practice and Im not sure when but I know someone will be hit by a discus someday which could potentially kill them cause thats what happens when a 3lbs disc is flying at 20+mph slams into your head. We also have a rule where if you can come to 4/5 of the practices you basically just shouldn't come. My friend he has to miss a few days a week but is willing to make them up over the weekend taking No one else's but his time to run. But of course Granville says he should just quit. Mind you he\u2019s been running track since middle school. A little fun stupid rule we have is we can\u2019t run with our shirts off (guys) or in sports bras (girls). Which is so incredibly stupid cause when it hits 80 degrees + and we just ran our arses off and have a few more reps to go those shirts are going off. Its also just a runners pride thing to do build up a sweat enough to get those runners abs to glisten and then show off to the world. The last thing would be captains. Granville threatened the upper class men by saying \u201ccaptain positions, are available for anyone who appears to be a leader, this could mean a freshmen could be a captain.\u201d Some of y'all will probably be well just step up then. Heres the thing if we do then we suck up to Granville boosting his already peaked in high school \u201cGOAT\u201d ego but on the plus we get to be captain. Or we could do nothing have a freshmen who doesn\u2019t understand anything be a captain. The complete final rule was to not question his training styles/methods or anything in general. Even though we already have injured team mates, terrible workouts and horrible communication throughout the team. This may not seem strict but the track team is built on preppies (people who do it for the prep) and w/o them, we pretty much have no team. I\u2019m just kinda done with track now so I guess I quit.",

(Armada, Hungrybox, Mango, Mew2King, and PPMD). There\u2019s also classic players who used to be the best like Ken or KDJ. They still participate in tournaments but aren\u2019t as good as the Five Gods.\neSports also have professional clans, like FaZe, Cloud 9, or OpTiC, just like real sports teams.\nYes, the athletes aren\u2019t physically moving but they still have to be really good to get to where they are and it still takes a lot of skill to be that good.\neSports are real sports, people!",

Telling my brother not to grow up like me ruined my whole day and I hope you're happy about that. You know how much I have suffered? Well you don't know, you don't know much mental trauma I have to go through everyday. Everyday I have to tell myself I'm a good person. Everyday I try to better myself by respecting people and improving my cons. I get mad at myself for shit I done in the past but I forgive myself because I'm a better person now. I been abused by several people for more than 5 fucking years. I don't tell this to anyone anymore because I forgave them. It's hard for someone who had been kicked punched gossiped plates thrown at them judged to forgive people. I been judged by how I look and I look at the mirror everyday and take pictures of my face everyday to prove to myself I'm not ugly. I been doing this for years now. I changed my appearance just so I could see who really respects me and it works because tons of people judge me for it and now I know who to trust and who not too. Because there's a shit ton of fake people in this world and now I know who they are. Last year I got cuts all over my body and my forehead from fights with someone and coming back and being treated the same way but emotionally is fucked up. You don't know how many people I had to protect because they hurt me. I don't Judge anyone because I know how it feels to be fucking judged. I'm not telling a quarter of what I been through. I try to be kind to everyone because I just know how it fucking feels to be in the lowest of the fucking sewer. Being misplaced in a. special education to cover up my bad grades from physical and mental abuse sucks ass but oh well. I hope you're happy now you ruined my day. I know this is what you want. But if you come near me I'll fuck you up. But of course I won't because I'll see myself in you. A insecure asshole. Something of the past. I got my laptop broken by someone I got my forehead slashed by them. I had cuts and bruises all over my body. I want my brother to better himself and you come and tell him not to be like me. Of course I don't want him to be like me I don't want him to go through what I went though but I want him to respect others and work hard and believe in himself. and man I just don't know why you would say that to me. You seemed friendly but hey people change all the time so you're probably going through shit too. I know you probably think I'm a loser because of rumors and shit but hey if you want to know me talk to me. Don't avoid me and then talk to others about me. That's some weak shit I used to do that all the fucking time. Come and talk to me in real life. Tell me how messed up I am and why I'm such a loser and look into my fucking eyes motherfucker. I used to cry myself everyday because I couldn't sleep because of all the physical abuse and all the rumors. I know I'm not perfect I used to do things that hurt other people and I didn't realize what I did until later and I beat myself over these things all the time.But I too forgive myself otherwise I will never become better. But I just want to let you know those words hurt me so much because I been trying to improve myself for a long time now. I'm a better person now, I respect others even if they hate me for my past. I don't expect an apology though because well I'm not sure if you care. You can lie to me and say it was a joke but motherfucker you're lying to yourself, I know you don't like me. I know when people smile at me with their eyes wide open they're judging.",

[2020] PLEASE READ: STANDARDS-BASED GRADING\nTLDR; come to the Board meeting tomorrow to speak up about your opinions on removing homework as a part of your final grade for a class or comments on Standards-Based Grading as a whole. Meeting is at 25 Churchill Avenue. Discussion will probably begin around 8 PM.\nThe upcoming School Board meeting this Tuesday (1/14) is an important one. The Board will have a discussion on amending Board Policy pertaining to Grading and Evaluation of Student Achievement. This paragraph will be added to the current document:\n\"A teacher shall base a student's grades solely on the quality of the student's academic work and his/her mastery of course content based on district standards. Students shall have the opportunity to demonstrate this mastery through a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, tests, projects, portfolios, and/or class discussion as appropriate. Other elements that are not a direct measure of knowledge and understanding of course content, such as attendance, effort, student conduct, and work habits, shall not be factored into the academic grade but may be reported separately.\"\nI believe this new grading policy is a precursor to the implementation of Standards-Based Grading where academic and behavioral aspects of learning are separated and behavioral aspects will no longer be factored into your final grade. While not explicitly stately, through my conversation with administrators, homework would be considered a behavioral aspect of learning. Effectively, this amendment to Board Policy allows the Board to remove homework as a factor into academic grades.\nRead the entire document here: https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/pausd/Board.nsf/files/BKNTMJ749F07/$file/20200114BP5121GradesEvaluationOfStudentAchievementPROPOSED.pdf\nIf you have any opinions about this change that will impact thousands of middle and high schools students in the future (you should!), PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE come to tomorrow's Board meeting to share it. One or two students giving speeches will not be enough for Board members to realize the gravity of this change.\nTime: Jan. 14; Board meeting starts at 6:30 PM. However, I expect the Board to reach this agenda item around 8 PM. I'll keep everyone updated.\nLocation: 25 Churchill Avenue (main meeting room in the right side of the district office)\n--Claire Cheng\nclairecheng02@gmail.com",

Both Marxism and conservatism are uncommon views in this area, and as a result, members of both groups often downplay their political beliefs in public. Also, you called conservatives \"blind to the actual reality of things,\" which is comparable to someone saying, \"Democrats need to open their eyes!\"\n[8607. [2021] The amount of people who say that \"Gunn is so left-wing I'm hashtag oppressed for being a conservative uwu\" are just so blind to the actual reality of things. Like I don't know how to tell you this, but conservatives have never been radical or against the status quo. They want preservation of old and outdated ideals. I always tell people that I'm a \"democratic socialist\" to avoid people automatically assuming that I'm a USSR-worshipping tankie by saying that I'm a Marxist. Also, please learn that Marxism encompasses a wide variety of ideologies (I align most closely with anarcho-syndicalism).]",

Almost every 10th grader knows that he acts as though he were deemed chief chemistry teacher by the almighty himself. He is sure that he is the paladin of education, swearing to his sacred \u201clife teachings\u201d beyond all limits of objective evaluation. It seems he is entirely unaware of his questionable egotism--blaming students\u2019 difficulties with the class not on his endless hours of lecturing about the vain imaginary student, \u2018your friend\u2019, but instead projecting the qualities of \u2018your friend\u2019 onto them as the reason for their struggle. The rallying against \u2018your friend\u2019 ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy, for when students display even the slightest complaint against his class, he sees them as \u2018your friend\u2019s, degrading them to mere grade-grabbers and not true learners of conceptual O\u2019Connell\u2122 philosophy. Still, in his unawareness of himself, when students end up having to study hours outside of class, he deems his class and teaching style a great success.\n^I wrote this meme-y paragraph while I still had OC.

I really dislike SELF, and I know a lot of people do too.\nIt s a waste of 50 minutes, learning about something that should be applied in our lives, however, it is either something we've already learned in our life, or it's something too naive and simplified to be work in reality.\nAnd it's really funny how they always talk about relieving stress from students when really SELF is just taking away time people have to either study or to just hangout with their friends.\nLike, okay Gunn.\nThank you for making my life so much easier and stress free!\nBut that's not my only issue with SELF.\nIt's the fact that, as someone who's going through depression, and has friend and family issues, a lot of the topics brought up in SELF are triggering for me. And when they portray it as something super two dimensional and fixable, and when they say it's a big deal but act like it's not, it hurts.\nA lot.\nBut it's not like I can just get up and leave or get mad or show my emotions because then people will know and my SELF teach will be like, \"Omg, share you situation and we can dissect is and figure it out together!!\"\nI have never met teachers with lower EQ than that.\nLike maybe you're okay with sharing your problems, but I'm not.\nAnd it sucks when people force you to open up. So you end up bottling it up and you feel really bad and right after is Day 3 B period, and then I have a test and I'm feeling really bad from SELF and I do bad on my test.\nLike ok.\nHelpful Gunn. Really really really helpful.\nAnd that's not my only issue with Gunn.\nIt's the fact that they portray it as such a happy, friendly, open school. Like it's got nothing to hide.\nBut needless to say, Gunn friend groups are literally set in stone. You can't get in, and if you get kicked out, the gates locked behind you.\nSo, how exactly do you make friends if you didn't have friends from middle school?\nRight, you don't.\nBig brain moments.\nSo, as someone who's only friends go to other school, it too socially awkward and mentally weak to try and find friends, when am I happy at Gunn?\nDuring FLEX when I'm playing video games with my Paly friends.\nThat's when.\nSo.\nYeah.\nGunn sucks.\nThank you for reading this you're the best we should rebel against Gunn and nobody goes to SELF because SELF is dumb and FLEX>>>>> SELF ok I'm tired bye.",

By commenting on this post and saying yes, BUT... and then adding some excuse, you\u2019re not making a difference, especially if you\u2019re Asian and on student council, you\u2019re just trying to defend yourself. Individuals aren\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s the non diversity of people\u2019s views.\nThere was a comment that said that \u201csounds a lot like the American government.\u201d\nI don't agree with you. Yes I agree that there needs to be a hell of a lot more diversity but you saying there is no diversity in the American government seems to be justifying the reason why it is okay to have little diversity in the SEC.\nHaving said that I agree that we voted for certain people and who chose to be on SEC.\nYou can disagree with me but be polite.",

Also note that details have changed to avoid sharing specific stories, and that the goal of this post is not to give a comprehensive evaluation on Linsdell or her teaching, but rather to warn students of some of the things that could occur (and have occurred) in her classes.\n1. If you have any shortcoming that makes you deviate from being a \"good student\", expect to answer for it in front of the class. This can range from one mistake you made one day to an ongoing behavior lapse. (And it did \u2013 being a \"good student\" most of the time didn't excuse you from being singled out in front of the class on the day you forgot a pencil.) You can bet on that it won't be discussed in private or with any degree of confidentiality.\n2. She has also sometimes approached students and singled them out by asking them to represent their racial and/or ethnic identity to the class (e.g asking about a specific political event, asking if they would want to choose a project relating to their specific identity, etc)\nAgain, I'm not trying to evaluate Linsdell as a teacher, much less as a person. This post is based on the assumption that, while students deserve for these things not to happen, if they are likely to happen, students deserve to know.",

    "content": "7384. [2020] For anyone wondering about Physics C summer homework, here's what happened last year. We got access to the materials only a couple weeks before the start of school, but the assignment was short (maybe 2-3 hours at most). It wasn't mandatory, only a little bit of extra credit. In terms of the content, most of it was actually review, since almost all of it was covered in analysis. I would expect either no summer assignment or a similarly short and easy one that will be released towards the start of next school year. If you want to see the summer homework from past years you can find it here: https://sites.google.com/a/pausd.org/dunbar-physics/class-b/summer-work-for-apc-physics",

In previous years, gunn theatre was extremely rude and divided, and although people have had their differences this year, no one actually hates each other as far as I\u2019m aware (which is a HUGE improvement from previous gunn theatre years) so please try to chill a little bit. Deniz and Arman have brought together Gunn Theatre in a way that no one thought was possible and have honestly and truly made it the least intimidating it has ever been! So kudos to them and please don\u2019t bring everyone down by writing stuff like this on confessions...i know that it\u2019s difficult to see the changes from a younger perspective, but two years ago, there was an actual sexual assaulter involved with theatre. In my opinion, we have vastly improved the quality of people in theatre while still managing to be welcoming to all. Nothing is perfect, but we can get as close as possible and I really think we\u2019re improving! Please just don\u2019t make generalizations like this that make everyone feel bad!\n[7147. I\u2019ve been a part of the theatre community for some time now and I have to say, it\u2019s kind of gotten bad. It\u2019s supposed to be a safe, welcoming, and supportive community, and honestly, I don\u2019t feel like it is anymore. This year it\u2019s gotten really cliquey and people are mean and judgmental and everyone talks about each other behind their backs and it\u2019s just gross. Obviously there are still a lot of awesome and supportive people in theatre, but a lot of them are mean and talk shit about people who are part of the theatre \u201cfamily\u201d which is so not what families should be like. This may be an unpopular opinion but I felt like I needed to share it.]",

One of my friend's parent does not want her to talk to anyone who is in lower level classes, I mean COME ON. The teachers don't have passion anymore, as in the first thing they say is how much the grade of something is, the culture has rubbed on to them. I hope this shitty culture changes, the passion comes back and kids take classes cause they want to and not cause of AP's, parents, etc",

    "content": "6618. @6606 First of all, most abortions not are jamming metal rods into the fetus\u2019 head. The abortion method you are probably referring to is called dilation and evacuation, however that has been banned since 2003 and only accounts for 0.2% of all abortions. Don\u2019t parenthesize \u201cthis is what happens\u201d when most of the time, it\u2019s not what happens. About 91% of all abortions in 2015 happened during the first trimester, meaning prior to the 13th week of the fetus\u2019 conception according to the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). This means most of the abortions are either vacuum aspiration, where the contents of the uterus are sucked out, or medicine-induced abortions. The abortion procedure you\u2019re referring to happens in the second trimester, and in that trimester, the mother needs consent from a doctor and it only happens IF the women needs protection according to the ruling of Roe v. Wade. However, these rules have changed and the regulations have most likely gotten stricter since the Supreme Court has gotten more conservative and are allowing regulations that contradict Roe v. Wade to slide. In the third trimester, since the fetus can survive outside of the mother, she cannot abort UNLESS her health is in serious danger. The states can say the mother can\u2019t abort since the baby now can survive without life support. So your comment on Democrats saying you can abort until birth is incorrect, because there is a ruling that says otherwise. After the first trimester, it\u2019s no longer just the woman\u2019s decision. But even so, at the end of the day, it\u2019s the woman\u2019s decision to abort. Even if abortion is illegal, the women will still do it for reasons like they aren\u2019t ready to have a child, emotionally, physically, and/or economically. Bearing that kind of responsibility changes your life forever. Even if you don\u2019t agree with abortion, I don\u2019t believe people should antagonize other people for it. It was their choice, if you had to make that choice, maybe you wouldn\u2019t make it, but they shouldn\u2019t be disrespected because they did what they thought was best.",

So by telling people that have to prove that they were raped, that could put them through a lot of trauma that they aren't ready for.

Yeah sometimes the class can be a bore, but if you claim to learn more from \"Wikipedia articles\" then by all means go ahead and learn from Wikipedia articles. No need to complain about a class that you signed up for. Let's be real, \"screwed up\" world views don't stem from an 11th grade history class. If someone has a certain viewpoint, not only are they entitled to it, but if it's as strong as most right-wing anti-SJW views, they will find a way to defend it. Rather than complaining about the lack of \"intellectually stimulating\" material in the lane 1 class that YOU signed up for, how about actively discussing your views with your teacher and make it stimulating. Stop pretending to be smarter than you are and blaming your issues on a class with a teacher who's probably doing the best they can? Shaming a teacher's curriculum on social media doesn't make you intelligent or bold, it makes you look and sound like a smartass.\n[5817: 5817. [2020] US History right now is honestly the worst class I have ever taken in my life. Not because it is difficult, but because it makes me lose my dignity. I am not sure it's just because of the teacher, but the quality of history taught in that class is really sub-par...]",

Tip to underclassmen: In the line of \"play to your strengths, not others weaknesses\", when applying to a school don't apply to an \"easy\" major thinking it's going to help you get in. I've been rejected from every school where I applied to a major that wasn't my true intended major, but I've had much better results where I actually was excited for what I was applying for. It's a combination of both what your extracurriculars show and a subconscious tone that rises within your essays that is really easily shows whether you're being authentic or not.",

Obviously not all teachers are created equal, but most of them are human just like us and understand mental health difficulties since a lot of them have experienced it themselves. If a teacher isn\u2019t understanding and still thinks of you as a \u201cbad student\u201d, as I\u2019ve been told personally, its just not worth it and I\u2019d highly recommend dropping the class. <3 u dude:) good luck\n[3740.

I'm not discrediting your accomplishment at all, congratulations, but it just irritates me how you got into a school AND boast in front of your friends who most likely did not get in due to their harder major.

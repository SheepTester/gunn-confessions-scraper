Now i\u2019m not saying that China did everything right, of course not, they also covered things up and ignored the problem at the beginnng. However, they did eventually pull it together and built 16 hospitals to treat people, the last of which just closed because they\u2019ve actually CONTAINED THE VIRUS. Look at South Korea, they\u2019ve got a less than 1% mortality rate because they took full preventative measures. So don\u2019t come lecturing me that I need to \u201ctoughen up\u201d or whatever the fuck because what definitely doesn\u2019t help an issue like this is people blaming a literal natural occurrence of a virus on an entire race of people. there have been a significant increase of hate crimes against asian people since the virus began, and it\u2019s not a coincidence. Yes, a lot of Chinese in the area support trump. that doesn\u2019t negate the people who have been unfairly discriminated against and hurt because of the ignorant, racist people who can\u2019t understand that they shouldn\u2019t be blaming people, they should just shut up and stay inside so it stops spreading.

Now i\u2019m not saying that China did everything right, of course not, they also covered things up and ignored the problem at the beginnng. However, they did eventually pull it together and built 16 hospitals to treat people, the last of which just closed because they\u2019ve actually CONTAINED THE VIRUS. Look at South Korea, they\u2019ve got a less than 1% mortality rate because they took full preventative measures. So don\u2019t come lecturing me that I need to \u201ctoughen up\u201d or whatever the fuck because what definitely doesn\u2019t help an issue like this is people blaming a literal natural occurrence of a virus on an entire race of people. there have been a significant increase of hate crimes against asian people since the virus began, and it\u2019s not a coincidence. Yes, a lot of Chinese in the area support trump. that doesn\u2019t negate the people who have been unfairly discriminated against and hurt because of the ignorant, racist people who can\u2019t understand that they shouldn\u2019t be blaming people, they should just shut up and stay inside so it stops spreading.

    "content": "9620. [2021] pass/fail literally sucks and I think we really need to band together and talk to the Gunn admin because there ARE better solutions. Please hear me out; foothill and most other colleges have a similar system to what we are doing now except they have options, students can choose to have pass/fail or receive an actual letter grade when taking a course and we should have the same system and let students choose. Pass:fail should still be an option because some people need it, if they can\u2019t complete as much work because their family is sick or etc... but for the rest of us, having this semester of grades matters and we would rather not have pass/fail.\nit works for about half of Gunn students, aka the seniors who are chilling in second semester and don\u2019t need grades, and the freshman who\u2019s grades don\u2019t even matter for UCs. For the rest of us, it\u2019s a whole semester of grades that can boost your GPA missing; especially those of us who were counting on having this semester to boost it and chose our courses based on this fact.\nFor sophomores, now they have to get great grades in junior year when they will be taking APS and much harder classes because they don\u2019t have the cushion of sophomore year grades to back them up. This is extremely unfair because they will suffer much more stress in junior year, when the majority are taking the SAT, starting to think about college, and have difficult classes.\nFor juniors, this was their last chance to boost their GPA and get good grades and that\u2019s been unfairly taken away from them. The hard classes you took that would have affected your weighted GPA now do not and you basically took it for nothing. A whole semester is gone from the grade book.\nSome may say that \u2018a semester doesn\u2019t make a difference\u2019 and \u2018colleges will overlook it\u2019 but it puts us at a great a disadvantage compared to other students from other schools who are NOT doing pass/fail, (and the majority are not) and will have these grades when they are applying for college.\nLets step it up and convince the admin or at least do something.\n#GunnConfessions9620",

A lack of structured curriculum, test preparation, and varying circumstances with home life means that grades would be very unlikely to go up, but rather more likely to go down.

Everyone is so loveable in this anime, even that one guy that\u2019s gloomy all the time. It\u2019s basically one giant satire of romance (pay attention to the narrator).\nGenre: Romance, School, Comedy\nYour Lie in April \u2014 a nice romance complete with music! Character development is really apparent and fun to see. Also the music is really good :P\nGenre: Music, Romance, School, Drama\nAcchi Kocchi \u2014 personally, I really love this one. Everyone is super cute, and there\u2019s not much drama involved: it\u2019s basically purely warm and fuzzy moments.\nGenre: Romance, Comedy, Slice of Life\nI\u2019ll do some more later if more people want it haha.\n[#GunnConfessions9610]\n#GunnConfessions9621",

    "content": "9620. [2021] pass/fail literally sucks and I think we really need to band together and talk to the Gunn admin because there ARE better solutions. Please hear me out; foothill and most other colleges have a similar system to what we are doing now except they have options, students can choose to have pass/fail or receive an actual letter grade when taking a course and we should have the same system and let students choose. Pass:fail should still be an option because some people need it, if they can\u2019t complete as much work because their family is sick or etc... but for the rest of us, having this semester of grades matters and we would rather not have pass/fail.\nit works for about half of Gunn students, aka the seniors who are chilling in second semester and don\u2019t need grades, and the freshman who\u2019s grades don\u2019t even matter for UCs. For the rest of us, it\u2019s a whole semester of grades that can boost your GPA missing; especially those of us who were counting on having this semester to boost it and chose our courses based on this fact.\nFor sophomores, now they have to get great grades in junior year when they will be taking APS and much harder classes because they don\u2019t have the cushion of sophomore year grades to back them up. This is extremely unfair because they will suffer much more stress in junior year, when the majority are taking the SAT, starting to think about college, and have difficult classes.\nFor juniors, this was their last chance to boost their GPA and get good grades and that\u2019s been unfairly taken away from them. The hard classes you took that would have affected your weighted GPA now do not and you basically took it for nothing. A whole semester is gone from the grade book.\nSome may say that \u2018a semester doesn\u2019t make a difference\u2019 and \u2018colleges will overlook it\u2019 but it puts us at a great a disadvantage compared to other students from other schools who are NOT doing pass/fail, (and the majority are not) and will have these grades when they are applying for college.\nLets step it up and convince the admin or at least do something.\n#GunnConfessions9620",

I definitely think that this sucks for people who had just worked themselves into a really good-looking place for the first quarter, but this corona would likely cause mass grade deflation. A lack of structured curriculum, test preparation, and varying circumstances with home life means that grades would be very unlikely to go up, but rather more likely to go down. Also, aren\u2019t a couple of colleges also going to look past this semester? What do you all think?\n#GunnConfessions9611",

He recently made out with another girl, and told the exact same people that he refused to let me tell for fear of it being \"leaked.\" He's pursuing a relationship with her, and everyone is allowed to know. And it makes me feel like shit because not only am I no longer good enough for him, she's so much more enough that he's okay letting everyone know about her and not me.

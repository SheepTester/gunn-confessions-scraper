NOT that he ISN\u2019T a rapist, but\u2014at least from what we know from katie hui\u2019s ig story and the change.org\u2014not ALL of the 20+ women\u2019s testimonials included rape. They included a range from \u201crape, sexual battery, groping, sexual coercion, menace for speaking out, child pornography, and other non-consensual actions.\u201d I am in NO WAY SAYING IT\u2019S ANY LESS BAD. I just think especially in situations such as these that it\u2019s super important we read carefully to really understand the stories and hopefully work to solve the issue so these horrible things can\u2019t keep happening\u2014and also not further divide ourselves when we\u2019re (I think) on the same side of the issue and need to work together (eg post 10313)\n[#GunnConfessions10313]\n#GunnConfessions10330",

    "content": "10325. [2021] @10251 As someone who came to Palo Alto from a district that was suffering, I couldn't agree more. At my old school they were funded purely by the state, and had no music or art, the library was shutting down, we had one computer room with old technology, etc. When I cam to Palo Alto it was amazing to see what funding can do. It shouldn't be like that. it shouldn't be because we can afford to and choose to have higher property taxes go towards education that we get better quality learning that others. It should be equal.\nBut that doesn't mean we have to lose the quality we have. I don't want to have to go back to a district with no arts or library. Where teachers get laid off every year and class sizes are getting bigger.\nThe solution is not defund Palo Alto schools, but appeal to the state to fund the other districts.It can be done. It was done. But when CA passed Prop 13 it slashed funding for the schools. Prop 13 was meant to save homeowners from paying increasingly higher property taxes. But the law also applies to large companies. As a result, Intel is paying like 10c an acre, the same rate they initially paid. And then, CA schools dropped from being in the top 5 in the nation to 49th.\nThis is how we get the money to fund schools across the state. We don't need to take from Palo Alto to gain equality. (And no this won't drive businesses out almost every other state has this. CA doesn't.)\n[#GunnConfessions10251]\n#GunnConfessions10325",

    "content": "10322. Follow up to #10313...\nYour point about that case is well taken. What you\u2019ve described is, in fact, rape, and I think it would be fair to characterize Nicholas Zhao as a rapist.\nHowever, my contention wasn\u2019t mainly that Nicholas Zhao is not a rapist, although I will admit I hadn\u2019t read that particular testimonial. Rather, my point was that I fundamentally disagree with the ethos of these kind of click-baity headlines that sacrifice truthfulness for attention-grabbing flashiness. At best it\u2019s terrible writing, and at worst, as I\u2019ve said before, it takes points that have merit and makes them wholly untruthfull. In much the same way as it would be an awful idea to charge George Floyd\u2019s murderers with first degree murder as it would result in the aquittal of criminals easily guilty of a lesser murder charge, it is counterproductive and stupid to make claims you have no intention of being able to back up, even in something as simple as this petition.\n\u201cNicholas Zhou has been raping women (over 20) since high school\u201d is a statement that sets up a petition for failure! The response of anyone who clicks on that only to NOT see 20, much less over 20, testimonials that would consistute rape is to distrust the petitioner! Clearly the petitioner has no problem lying in the title/link of their petition in the interest of garnering signatures, what\u2019s to stop them from lying in the contents of the petition itself?!\nNow, in this case I very much believe the people who have come forward and I support action against Zhao. But it is precisely because I am on the side of this petition that I implore people, generally, to adopt a truthful dispotion in what they say. Never has an argument been made stronger by lies, nor weaker by telling the truth.\nFinally, Merriam\u2013Webster is a laughably flaky dictionary that as recently as four days ago agreed to change the definition of racism at the behest of a woman seemingly out of 1984\u2019s newspeak department: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/merriam-webster-racism-definition.html.\nThe UCR definition of rape, and the law of this country, is not so loosely goosey as to be possibly confused by the obtuse with non-consensual handholding, and will remain next week despite any emails that may be sent to the justice department:\n\u201cThe penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\u201d\nI am of the opinion it is in the interest of women\u2019s-rights advocates to adhere to this definition of rape and not toss the word around lightly, so that it may have power and meaning when it is actually called for, as in the case you\u2019ve indicated. But there are certainly not 20 such testimonials that would meet this criteria and it weakens the petition to say otherwise. Further, it is hurtful to actual victims of rape to use a wide definition as it equates lesser traumatic acts of unclear consent with violent, traumatic acts by a real rapist.\nI write all this in the defense of language that I see is slowly being perverted in much the way Orwell foreshadowed in his 1946 essay\u2014an essay which made all the points I\u2019ve made here only more eloquently and with more efficient prose\u2014Politics and the English language.\nThis kind of definition-changing to suit an agenda is a first step in the decline of free speech. The next step will be the censoring of opinion pieces in the press as the New York Times has just done, but that\u2019s an argument for another day...\n[#GunnConfessions10313]\n#GunnConfessions10322",

    "content": "10304. [2022] In response to Neha over post 10290: Long read, but if you actually care about the issue then... In the first sentence of said post, it was stated that the death was \"wrongful\", a statement which is accepted by nearly everyone in society. No one is defending Derek Chauvin's actions, and even given the highest benefit of doubt, he is still very clearly in the wrong. Kneeling for 3 minutes on the neck of an unconscious individual is murder. However, the point stated in the post seems to be this: Derek Chauvin is a criminal. This does not justify going door to door, finding everyone remotely tied to him (including the rest of the Minneapolis police force), and attacking them over \"institutionalized and systematic racism.\" Rather, the crime stays with the criminal. In the same way that the whole African American male population is not attacked over the 50 percent of murders and ~35 percent of all violent crime. In the same way, democratic politicians, who advocate against drastic methods to stop the inflow of illegal immigrants (just making illegals legal will not change the types of people that are coming over without allowing for acceptance of immigration petition), are not attacked over the fact that federal and state prisons in the United States are made up of over 25% criminal illegal immigrants. (No one said not pushing a zero tolerance policy was at fault, but rather the lack of producing any drastic measure of restraint on illegals). Lastly, it is important to address your claim that police are encouraged to be brutal. First off, police are human too. And especially in shitty neighborhoods, they are essentially going to war. Every day they drive around these neighborhoods expecting to get into gun fights. The only difference is that in war, you know the enemy. In these neighborhoods, you are never allowed to see the enemy and fire first. In addition, the \"enemy\" in this case are American citizens. Naturally, in this urban war, police make tactical mistakes such as going to the wrong door on a no-knock warrant, which resulted in the owners of that home firing in self defense, police firing back, and Breonna Taylor accidentally being killed (not racial incident). This is the reason why police are harder to prosecute, just as it would be hard to prosecute a soldier who wrongfully killed a civilian of another country during wartime. They are doing a difficult, dangerous job. Again, this is a general truth about the difficulty of prosecuting police, not a justification of the disgusting act by Derek Chauvin. Not to mention, I would like to ask that you provide a single case in the last ten years where policies are \"rooted in systemic racism\" or ESPECIALLY trained \"to adopt racist strategies.\" Just try. I highly doubt such a training method or racist policy exists (except for maybe affirmative action). [#GunnConfessions10290] #GunnConfessions10304",

[Gunn parent! ] This is in response to #GunnConfessions10283, the student whose mother is forcing her to major in CS.\nI'm a parent and would usually never think of posting here, but in this case I feel the need to speak up. I experienced something very similar a few decades ago when I was your age. I suspect that like me, you are a second generation child of Asian immigrant parents.\nThe only person who should decide what you do in your career is you. You--not your mother, not your father--are going to be the one spending your waking hours for many, many years working in your career, so you'd better have an interest in what you're doing.\nRelated to this: the idea that you somehow need to follow your parents' plan for your adult life because they \"sacrificed\" for you is manipulative garbage. Becoming a parent myself had made this very clear to me. My spouse and I care for our children, talk to them, spend countless hours with them--because we love them and because that's just what good parents do. Raising kids does not incur a \"debt\" that needs to be \"repaid\". Being able to spent lots of time with my kids under the same roof is a precious phase of life that will end all too soon. Having these years and building a close relationship with my children are the single best experience of my life. It's all the \"repayment\" that I need.\nImmigrant parents are coming from a different perspective than you are. They arrive in this country as non-native English speakers with heavy accents, and they cannot hope to completely understand American culture, humor--or the American job market and economy. Not surprisingly and with some justification, they think their only path to financial stability is a purely technical career: doctor, engineer, anything where being really good at taking tests and doing math will get you far and where personality, communication and other soft skills don't matter as much.\nBut you are American, and you have doors open to you that your parents aren't even aware of. Similar to you, my parents pretty much made me major in something technical in college. But I never had an interest in the subject and after graduation, I immediately took things in a more business-oriented direction with my career. When I went to grad school, I made sure I paid for it myself so that I could make all my own decisions about what I studied. In the end, things have worked out pretty well for me.\nI'm sure your mom loves you and only wants what's best for you. But *you* also want what's best for you. Making your own decisions and charting your own path in life is the only way to become a full-fledged adult. This country is filled with sad, frustrated 2nd generation Asian American doctors and engineers who dutifully chose careers according to their parents' demands. On some level, they exist in a state of stunted maturity, unable to act as fully-functioning adults, forever in the shadow of controlling immigrant parents who made so many \"sacrifices\" for them. Don't become one of them. Choose your own career, and live your own life!\n#GunnConfessions10302",

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d I was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but he kept cutting me off and going \u201chuh? huh? huh?\u201d and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen ice cream cones in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the cones and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical interference,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each cone and put them in a cardboard holder and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by screaming about malarkey really loudly.\n#GunnConfessions10299",

[2020] From The Economist:\n\"Pessimism is self-defeating, too It is a short step from thinking that America's original racial sin is so deep that it cannot be overcome, to thinking that smashing and burning things is justified, because it is the only way to get attention. Yet if today's protests slide into persistent rioting, as in 1968 after Martin Luther King's assassination, the harm they cause could be felt most keenly in African-American districts. Those people who can leave will. The left-behind will be worse off, as home values plunge and jobs and shops disappear. The police may withdraw, leading to an increase in crime, which in turn may eventually bring more violent policing. The scars will be visible for decades...When rioting takes hold, those who support the protests may find that their demands for change are drowned out by the clamour for order to be re-established.\"\n#GunnConfessions10287",

I am not only going to blame \u201cGunn\u201d but I feel like It is very important for people of color to represent and show where they are from.\nI don\u2019t like the fact that a minority Hispanic group is called Mexicans when you don\u2019t even know where each one of us are from.

I know that not everyone who is saying \u201cdefund\u201d is advocating for completely getting rid of the police, but to those who advocate for completely abolishing the police, I have a few concerns. To clarify, I do think that shifting responsibility away from the police when it comes to tackling issues like homelessness, mental health and drugs is a great idea. I\u2019m posting this here to hopefully get some responses to educate myself; not trying to spark an argument.\n1. Reallocating money isn\u2019t going to completely get rid of structural issues so how do you expect crime to decrease so drastically?\n2. How do you prevent vigilante groups? I\u2019m fearful that they\u2019re going to be comprised of rich white people mostly. Aren\u2019t you going to have the same (or worse) racism occurring because of this?\n3. It\u2019s no secret that not all crimes are because of societal issues (stalking, rapes and murders, kidnappings etc.) How do you fight these? This brings me back to my point about vigilantes: people taking matters into their own hands in matters like this could be extremely dangerous.\n4. If you\u2019re someone new to the neighborhood, how do you feel safe? You have no connections with anyone in the community if something scary is going on.\n5. Police have access to large databases which help them track down criminals. How will crime-fighting work without these?\nI know that the policing system is far from great now, and the racism it perpetuates is terrible. But I don\u2019t see how leaving crime up to the community (who can very well be far more racist) with pretty much no checks is going to solve anything.\n#GunnConfessions10271",

Don\u2019t hate on the police, the men are in blue are risking their lives to protect each and every one of you.

I fully believe that all lives matter, but I believe that people need to realize that there were some bad instances.

I have no doubts that many cops joined the force for the right reasons, but I truly don\u2019t think that they can do their job how they are supposed to while following strong and good moral guidelines. All cops are bastards, but some are still good once they take off the badge.\n#GunnConfessions10259",

[2021] As an Asian American female, I get where y'all are coming from when you say that there should've been more action taken when it came to hate crimes against Asian Americans because of the pandemic. The hypocrisy of the people who slandered us and then showed support for the BLM movement needs to be pointed out. However, we must consider that in general, our circumstances are very different. This may be an unpopular opinion, but the resurgence of hate crimes against my race is short-lived compared to the multitude of hate crimes against the Black American population that have been occurring for 500 years due to systematic racism. We are often perceived as the model minority, and with that comes privilege. I don't have to live in constant fear of being targeted by the police. When there's a burglar at my house, my first instinct doesn't have to be, solve it yourself because bringing a police officer in might risk your safety. And that's the difference. This movement is protesting police brutality and racism that is skewed toward our Black American population. It's not just about George Floyd's murder, but the murders of thousands of Black Americans by the police that have gone unnoticed. We are protesting policy here, we are protesting the mistreatment of Black Americans by a group that is meant to protect us, we are protesting the widespread institution so that our fellow POC's can live without being in constant fear, without being discriminated against like they have been for centuries. We should unite to support our Black American population so they can support us in the future.\n#GunnConfessions10230",

As an Asian American, I believe that it is our moral duty to stand with the African Americans against the systematic injustice and oppression imposed by the implicit bias of police officers and the corresponding overreaches in recurring episodes of brutality, and I am sure much of my community parallels my views and my drive to catalyze change.\nTo be sure, African Americans have seldom lent their aid to Asian Americans in times of crisis, and sometimes they have even perpetuated Asian American misfortunes--as with the LA riots of 1992, where African Americans infamously targeted Koreatown and other Asian Businesses in LA based on the shallow and specious ideology that Koreans posed a cultural and economic threat, an ironically xenophobic sentiment coming from a fellow racial minority that seeks to break down racial barriers. Further evidence of African American apathy and even injustice against Asian Americans is present in the more recent COVID-19 pandemic, where African Americans not only stood as silent bystanders while Asian American-owned stores were being vandalized and robbed, but also were caught on camera physically attacking elderly Asian Americans and women in a cruel form of revenge. It seems that when it comes to fighting for the advancement of African Americans, when minorities should band together in solidarity against oppression, Asian Americans often end up with the short end of the stick--fighting for widespread, non-race-specific justice that seems to eventually culminate on an African American focus to the detriment of Asian Americans.\nYet, we retain hope. We trust that America was the land of the free that our parents immigrated to. We trust in the American dream. We trust that this is the land of the free. At the end of the day, we are all Americans, and the only way to get through this is together. For these reasons, we choose to overlook the past and turn only to improving the future, for African Americans and for all races. In a country of immigrants, of foreigners, of minorities, we choose to stand with African Americans and continue to support our fellow minority brothers and sisters, for the good of the country and for the good of Americans. Together, we fight your fight.\n#GunnConfessions10222",

Idk about all around the route, but at least at Gunn with all the teachers there was just so much positivity and fun, and I really needed that right now. Thank you to whoever organized it/came up with it.\nAlso can we just make it a tradition?

I also saw that the cnn building in atlanta was vandalized, and based on articles I've read and pictures I've seen, it seems to be a part of the protests (but please let me know if it isn't). is there a particular reason for this? when I've tried to look it up, the only articles I can find is how trump doesn't like them, so is it particular political, racial, religious, etc. groups that don't like cnn? and would supporting them and using them as a news source be detrimental to the blm movement?\nfinally, i've been seeing a lot of book and film recommendations to educate yourself. a prominent one I've seen is white fragility: why it's so hard for white people to talk about racism. would people recommend this for non-black pocs? based off the title, it seems like it's directed towards white people, but if it's still a good way to learn, I would like to read it. on a related note, some of the books on these lists are available with the pausd overdrive thing, so if you can't or don't want to spend money, i suggest starting there! (but a lot of them are checked out right now, so you might have to wait)\nthanks in advance to anyone who answers these questions, they're purely for my own curiosity and education. please don't feel obligated to answer any of these, and if they are offensive topics, i'm truly sorry. i just want to do anything i can to help, which includes educating myself.\n#GunnConfessions10205",

Other examples hearing an african american talking without slang and their african american friends would tell them they are not black enough. How does that make sense? It's like people put these labels on themselves because they are peer pressured from other people from the same race or gender. There's also the thing with males, we aren't encouraged to cry. Why because that's \"feminine\"? How is that feminine that is a human emotion.

I support the current movement, but it says a lot that there has been incredible amounts of posting for BLM, yet for the life of me I cannot remember the last time people actually gave a damn about racism towards Asians. This movement has been in place for a week or so, yet during the multiple-month span that we have been in quarantine, and even before that, there were countless reported accounts of racist and violent acts committed towards Asians. I don't think any of you can say that you care about racism towards Asians if not one of you even posted a story like you do multiple times a day for BLM. I remember an instance at GUNN, where a sophomore flipped me off and said \"fuck you, you have the coronavirus\". What the fuck? Racism is racism, yet for months you actively ignored prominent Anti-Asian racism and only now you \"act\" after a despicable murder has occurred. Is that what it takes for y'all to finally give a shit about Asians? Genuinely curious.

Since the loosening of Title IX rules came up a bit before George Floyd was murdered and racism took center stage, I think there should be talk about racial bias in sexual assault proceedings. Evidence shows that black men accused of sexual misconduct by white women are far more likely to be found guilty and face disciplinary action than white men or men accused by minority women. Of course, that is not to say that the accusations by whites against blacks were false, or that the accused white men were guilty, but this is something we should all consider, as we must not perpetuate racism in the fight against sexism and sexual violence.\n#GunnConfessions10194",

I know this is going to be controversial, but I truly cannot believe that I'm seeing so many posts calling me privileged because I'm upset that innocent lives are being taken and destroyed in these riots. I too am disgusted by the systematic oppression of POC and want to see justice and change. However, there are occupied buildings with children and innocents alike getting burned down and then blocked by rioters who don't want to let the firefighters help those inside. There are random people's cars getting smashed on the freeway. There are small businesses, already suffering from the economic impact of COVID-19, getting destroyed, looted, or burned down. There are shop owners who are being beaten and killed simply for trying to defend their own store. When are people going to realize that participating in or defending these horrific events makes them no better than the people they are angry with in the first place? We are in outrage over the lives of innocent black people that are being taken, but it's suddenly okay to endanger the lives of children and fellow BLM advocates? I see so many Gunn kids posting/commenting defending these riots, but if you really want to talk about privilege and ignorance, do you think your opinion may be different if it was YOUR family's store being looted and destroyed? If it was YOUR parents that were being burned in their own home? I honestly cannot understand how so many of you are defending this. I understand that everyone is feeling desperation and helplessness, but I genuinely believe in my heart that there are other ways. There HAS to be. It's actually heartbreaking to see what our country has come to. We've already lost over 100,000 lives due to COVID; please stop encouraging the loss of even more.\n#GunnConfessions10176",

Of course the looting is bad, but you can\u2019t write off the whole movement just because of it. A lot of the people doing it aren\u2019t even with the cause and are just taking advantage of the chaos to do wrong and I\u2019ve seen many instances of actual protestors stopping those people. The vast majority of protestors are peaceful and their cause is to end unnecessary violence and killings by police. When all attention is brought to the small minority of detractors as if they represent the whole movement, like the police are doing, it puts many innocent people in danger of being hurt or even killed. Please, if you truly care about the welfare of the people in this country, stop hyping up the looters and just donate to businesses harmed if you can. I am in no way trying to justify their actions, but we need to stop giving them a platform.\n#GunnConfessions10175",

I can understand how you feel, if protests get violent, police have more pressing issues than protecting your house. If it helps, you can also come up a plan in case your house starts getting attacked; having a plan can help you feel more in control and safer.

Right now, we are caught up in the midst of intense discussions of race to an extent that none of us have seen in our lifetimes. George Floyd was MURDERED at the hands of police and the nation\u2014heck the world\u2014is responding in full force. We are seeing mass protests, riots, and widespread social media posts rallying against a broken system that actively oppresses Black bodies on a daily basis. Society may be up in flames, but the issue of race is in the national spotlight and we are finally paying attention. For many of us, the shock of what is happening has opened our eyes to our silence, our complicity, and our racial prejudices. We have signed petitions, donated money, educated ourselves, protested, and pledged to take action to combat racism within our own lives.\nBut too often, the passion that we feel in the heat of the moment fades away as time goes on. Yet, racism is an ACTIVE, ONGOING, structural problem that does not disappear with time. Fighting the system requires us to stay vigilant and attentive. So let me ask the future:\nHow has society changed? Have all four officers that killed Mr. Floyd been convicted and sentenced? What have our state and national leaders done to correct the systemic flaws that allowed countless Black bodies to die at the hands of police? Did anything even change?\nWhat have YOU done? Did you stick to your pledge to correct your complicity in perpetuating the system? Have you witnessed any acts of racism in your life or around you\u2014did you remain silent or did you intervene? Did you have that tough but necessary conversation about race with your parents or friends?\nBlack Lives Matter is not a one-time temporary trend, so don't treat it as such. If you posted it on your instagram story, you better hold yourself accountable. True change requires continuous solidarity. I desperately hope that that is what we'll see in the future.\n#GunnConfessions10166",

For the reason that I think most people in Palo Alto realize the reasoning behind the protests, and why they are important for minorities, I won't add on to what has already been said.\nBut as an Asian-American, the riots and the looting that follows scares me. Every time this happens, Asian-American people and businesses are ALWAYS targeted. This does NOTHING but invalidate any support much of the Asian-American community has for the original protest. Especially for many in the first generation - they have seen too many stores get robbed, family members mugged. They've seen their kids - the same ones they worked so hard to get a better life for - get attacked at school, often by African-Americans. It's disappointing for me to see so many people justify the looting or rioting, especially when I know who will be affected the most. The rioters and looters will get a pass, many of them will probably get bailed out by your donations anyways. But I suspect many Asian businesses will close and their owners will leave. I see tons of people support Black-owned businesses. That's good, but as seen in previous protests, those are much more likely to be protected by the people of the neighborhood. Those same people often won't step in if the Korean supermarket across the street gets smashed up. It'll only be worse because one of the cops was Asian.\nThese are the same stores and businesses that already are suffering because of racism stemming from COVID-19. They've already had six months of extraordinarily low business or no business at all, and now they will return to a store that was burned down.\nYour bail fund money won't help them at all.\n#GunnConfessions10149",

Our justice system is. Sorry if that you\u2019re annoyed that ppl are finally over this shit.\n#GunnConfessions10146",

    "content": "10128. Hi! Author of 10106. I just want to clarify some of the stuff that I wrote, I misworded some of it and it didn't come across how I would've liked. Thanks to those who pointed out that the rioting is a necessary part of protesting and getting things to change and that a lot of these protests start peaceful but are escalated by the police. I completely agree and was trying to refer more to the fact that some people are going further than that and burning down small businesses, many of which are owned by members of the community who are black (which I think #10116 addresses well). Of course, a lot of times these are started by instigators, rather than by those who truly care for the movement. However, it is sometimes continued by those who claim to be a part of the blm movement. Some people continue to justify this, saying that it's all in the name of the cause, and that's where I disagree. I've seen videos of protest organizers stepping in front of these \"extremists\" (for a lack of a better word. sorry if that's not the right word or offensive, I literally can't think of a word) to prevent them from looting businesses, including a Target in New York. If the leaders of the blm movement think what they're doing is wrong, why would we (a majority of whom are commenting from the comfort of their homes) think that it's right?\nTo Livia: I definitely don't mean to demonize the rioters and protestors whose actions are actually to enable change and to garner attention to the cause. I wasn't specific enough in my first post, and I apologize if my words came off like that.\nTo Sophia, Joyce, and Ryan: Once again, I wasn't as specific in who I was referring to as I should've been. You all make very valid points, and I meant to talk about those who are only trying to cause chaos, rather than fight for the cause.\nOnce again, I'm not trying to start any arguments, just clarify what I had written in my first post and address some of the comments I saw.\n[#GunnConfessions10106]\n#GunnConfessions10128",

For all those saying that peaceful protests are not possible, or that sometimes violence is required to initiate change, I invite you to believe in the possibility of peaceful justice. Many of those living during the time of Gandhi, MLK, and the woman's suffrage movement had no faith in the possibility of peaceful protests, but ultimately, human perseverence succeeded. Yes, it may take months or years, it may take the lives of protestors just as it did when British officers opened fire upon a field of peaceful Indian protestors, but those losses only go to further expose the corruption of the system. We have to understand that fighting violence with violence with the intention of restoring peace is hypocritical and counterproductive. The innocent lives of small business owners should not be the casualty of unnecessary violence, just as Floyd's life was. If your argument is that protestors should not adhere to the laws of a system that is corrupt, then at least adhere to your own moral compass - must we turn on innocent civilians, loot stores and burn buildings, all with the intention to end the perpetuation of oppression? It is our duty, as those advocating for an end to oppression and with aspirations for a peaceful nation, that we adhere to our own advocations and protest peacefully. After all, the future of this nation begins with us - do we really want to continue this cycle of violence?\n#GunnConfessions10124",

    "content": "10120. There are a lot of videos out there from the protests from all across the country. An overwhelming amount show that while protesters are remaining peaceful, the police are becoming physical and violent in response, often times unprovoked. There have been reports that white supremacy groups are inciting violence and creating riots to blame it on people of color and to further divide this country.\nPlease understand that most of the rioting and looting of stores is NOT coming from protesters, and especially not POC protesters. Countless videos show white people, who have the privilege to be able to loot and destroy businesses without the fear of being attacked or killed by police, destroying these businesses and escalating the protests into riots. People who live in fear of the police know not to loot or become violent bc they will always lose. Don\u2019t use the destruction of businesses, many of which have come forward and said that they stand with the protesters (including small businesses who are probably not even insured!!), as an excuse to not support the movements and protests happening across America. And don\u2019t blame the violence all on the protesters. A HUGE amount of the violence is coming from the police. Just today, I\u2019ve seen at least 10 separate videos of people who were PEACEFULLY protesting being attacked by police officers. An officer threw a woman into a curb, who later had seizures. An officer pepper-sprayed a 9 year old girl in Seattle. An officer pulled down the mask of a black teen to mace him. An NYPD car drove into a crowd protected by a barricade.The LA protest became a riot only after the police arrived and shot people in the face with rubber bullets. In LA and Chicago, the police blocked off exits and turned off their body cams. ICE was called. This is violence that is unprovoked and illegal. The fact that not even two weeks ago we saw photos of white protesters with semi-automatic weapons yelling and screaming about their right to not wear a mask and to get a haircut and the police stood and did nothing, while now people who are kneeling in peaceful protest over a man\u2019s murder are being tear-gassed speaks to the racism of this country.\nI don\u2019t condone violence or looting. I am just so tired of seeing all these videos of people being attacked despite their constitutional right to express their opinions, only to come on here and see people complain about their social media being depressing or how businesses are important, because while yes, you\u2019re valid, it is depressing and hard to deal with, and I definitely don\u2019t support businesses being attacked, I also can\u2019t stand watching nothing be done or said about the real, living, breathing people who are being hurt by the uncalled for, and frankly illegal, actions of people who are meant to be protectors of citizens, not attackers. Justice needs to be brought not only to the officer who killed George Floyd, but also all of the police officers who believe that they are allowed to act in this way, hurting people for no reason, and get away with it, and if a Target gets wrecked, or you might have to avoid social media for a while, then so be it. It\u2019s uncomfortable to see all of these things happen, no doubt about it. But sometimes it has to be uncomfortable for things to change.\nPlease donate if you have the means necessary and sign petitions. Do research, learn. Please. And maybe, just maybe, we won\u2019t have to see any of this or have these conversations in the future if we make the change now.\n#GunnConfessions10120",

    "content": "10116. [2022] I usually don't tend to comment on political situations in a public setting but I couldn't help but notice some comments in #10098. I agree with the post itself, but I want to respond to some of its comments. Note: I have nothing against these people, many of them I know and are quite smart people, but nonetheless these comments I find worthy of a response. This is quite long so forgive me.\n\"All that shit is insured, riots are an important way to show political resolve. Ideally we'd be in a situation where peaceful protests could lead to change but clearly we're not\"\nSo what if it's insured? Firstly, having it insured doesn't make it any morally better, and two, insurance isn't some catch-all thing that will completely ensure any financial damages. If you see what those rioters did to many locally owned businesses, I doubt insurance will cover 100% of those costs, not to mention premiums will probably skyrocket, so in the end, insurance will do little. There's a good chance lots of people there don't really have insurance, some people can't be bothered to spend the money. Most middle Americans, heck, even around here don't have the money to spend on insurance, because who thinks rioters are going to attack a locally owned business after an instance of police brutality. It's not just Autozones and Targets, it's locally owned or small chain stores that provide to a community, that can't take a hit like that. Not to mention that many of the employees in these stores are probably going to get laid off until repairs can be made, only worsening the problem. Also, it doesn't show political resolve to attack innocent businesses or to steal flatscreen TVs. It shows selfishness. If you truly cared you be protesting in the correct manner. Not looting for stuff, you're not stopping racism, you're part of the problem. This commenter went on to say \"a majority of the demonstrations occured before he was taken into custody OR charged and they shouldn't be used as a distraction from or equated with a murder.\" I haven't seen any media equate this as a murder, because so far it isn't. It is a riot, still illegal and still wrong. A police officer was killed in Oakland after the original officer was arrested, they aren't just \"protesting brutality\" they are being brutal and cruel. I also am certain it is not a distraction. Tune in to MSNBC and you'll find countless pundits talking about how it's justified and how it's okay, at the same time showing the Twin Cities burning. Also, the officer has been arrested, and riots and protests are not letting up. They are ramping up. Atlanta, Twin Cities, Oakland, even the Bay Bridge was blocked. This is no longer about Floyd or the officer, this is an excuse to cause trouble. Think to yourself, do you think those people in Target, or those trashing CNN in Atlanta or those stopping traffic on a highway are thinking about Floyd or thinking that is solving the problem? I have my doubts.\n\"Like historically, riots have always been a thing, especially over matters concerning race. That is how people work; there is social antagonism and it had to erupt in some way eventually. Why is this confusing when something like this happens in present time?\"\nI would agree with this statement when a riot or protest does something of value or makes a clear statement. Trashing stores, burning cars, ruining communities isn't helpful. It is harmful. Nobody is watching these riots and thinking to themselves \"Well, now that I see this, I guess we have to take police brutality seriously\". Police brutality is not an excuse to burn parts of a city that had nothing to do with the incident. I find it confusing that this happens because I can't think of a single way of how this helps the problem. If anything all it's going to do is make cops more on edge around the nation and force the state of Minnesota to take more drastic action, which could lead to more problems. Nothing positive comes of this.\n\"Target refused to sell materials to counter-act tear gas. Such as milk. They could have chosen to do their job at the minimum level but that would help the protesters stay safe, so they refused. That\u2019s why they got looted.\"\nTarget is a private company that can do whatever they want. Ever see those signs that say \"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone\"? You can still not choose to serve someone even without that sign. Perhaps the manager decided to put a hold on selling milk or the higher-ups said something. Maybe the cashiers were too scared. No matter the reason they can do that, and I can't blame them. It's a bit unsettling when you see people rioting outside getting tear-gassed and then demanding that you sell them milk to help their eyes so they can keep going outside to riot even more. Then Target could be liable for being part of the problem. Again, Target being a private company does not justify these people destroying private property and people's sources of income.\n\"you mean besides donating 300,000 dollars to support the police department?\" (They linked a source, I just don't want to make this any longer) It's true the Target donated, but again, they're a private business, and they're business choices don't justify a riot. Also attacking on this basis implies that it is just to attack any store that donates to police, which I find to be far-fetched, and also assumes that police are all racist and bad which is nonsense. We don't even know if this was a racist incident (though it probably was). Also, that article posted stated that the donation was made in 2004. Taking a 16-year-old donation to help police officers as an excuse to terrorize the store, who may have changed ownership multiple times (even if it didn't it's still not justified) is disingenuousness of the highest order.\nI find it concerning that many people are sympathetic to this cause. I don't know what your situation is at home, but I'm willing to bet most of the people reading this are doing alright, so I find it a bit odd that you can say from the safety of your homes that those business owners will be fine when in reality, they probably won't be. I am not judging you for your opinion, I'm just voicing my own. Cheers.\n[#GunnConfessions10098]\n#GunnConfessions10116",

If you find yourself in a worse mental state after using social media but don't want to quit cold turkey, I recommend the following:\nFacebook: unfollow/snooze people/groups (click on the three dots in the top right of posts)\nTwitter: mute people (the v icon in the top right corner of posts). This should also hide things that they've liked and retweeted.\nInstagram: mute people by tapping on the three dots in the upper-right hand corner while on their profile page (I think you can only do this on mobile.) I also recommend disabling push notifications (select your profile picture and go to settings from there. Push notifications should be one of the options.)\nMessenger: You can choose to ignore messages (under \"Privacy and Support\" sidebar)\nReddit: Reddit is hard to avoid because you can't selectively filter out content. Try hiding posts on your homepage by hand or temporarily unfollowing particularly political subreddits.\nYou can also unfriend/unfollow people who post a lot, but muting has a similar effect without disappearing from their friends/followers list (and lets you still check in on them if you want to.)\nSocial media makes people happier if it's used with intention.\n[#GunnConfessions10110]\n#GunnConfessions10115",

Yes, maybe it sounds extreme to you but after years of people peacefully protesting to have no change occur, people eventually realize that more has to be done to actually change the way our country works.\nFurthermore, a lot of the most violent rioting/looting that has escalated many of the protests in large cities is not brought on by protesters, but by either police or by white/far right supremacists who are taking this chance to try and escalate the situation and blame it on POC. There are even some white supremacy organizations who have created fake protests in the hopes of baiting people who they can later incriminate. Many cops are even part of these organizations, while others may not be directly tied to the groups but are still choosing to escalate situations with protesters and abuse their power. Yes, not all cops are these people, but that does not change the fact that there are many that are, and that the institution of the police force is ready to defend them.\nThis has been a long post, sorry, but in the end, this has become a situation bigger than George Floyd. It\u2019s a rebellion against a country that has historically oppressed POC, especially black people, and if you look at how things change on a national level, sometimes it takes more than people holding a sign (especially when those people are part of the oppressed minorities). I\u2019m not advocating for violence in any way, shape, or form. I just wanted to provide a different perspective.\n[#GunnConfessions10106]\n#GunnConfessions10112",

However, the measures some people have gone to in the protests are a bit too far. I know that someone already posted it, but committing arson isn't the way to go and it's not going to change things. The only thing that will happen is that people's prejudices against POC being violent will even further engrained in their mind by seeing these violent acts. Some people brought up the fact that Target has ties to the police, which I understand, but there are innocent people that rely on their jobs at these stores to support their family. Not to mention, an affordable housing development was also burned. People that support this cause may have benefitted from this, and now it's being taken away from them for no reason other than people are taking protests too far. Some people may say that this is just in retaliation for what the police have done to the people peacefully protesting, but don't fight fire with fire. George Floyd was described as a \"gentle giant\" by his family and friends, and while I don't know him, I can't imagine this is how he would want to be remembered. Say his name, don't tarnish it.\nI don't mean to start any arguments, and I respect other people's opinions, including those who believe that everything that is happening is necessary, I just wanted to share my opinion and see if anyone thinks similarly.\n#GunnConfessions10106",

    "content": "10088. [One of the grades] THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY UNPOPULAR (hence why its I'm posting here)\nPersonally, I think there is a decent chance that the death of George Floyd was not due to the police and certainly was not an act of racism. There are simply too many holes to confirm this as am act of police brutality or racism\nTo start, George Floyd was observed to be in medical distress once they had arrested him, (prior to the whole neck thing) suggesting there was a prior condition that had been killing him. This is supported by the report and also why an ambulance was called in the first place. Furthermore the act of kneeling on George Floyd's neck is a restraint method taught to police and is considered non-lethal as it does not apply direct pressure on the airway. Plus, new security footage capturing the arrest, shows Floyd as either unwilling to stand up for police or unable (if unable, suggesting under influence). From these factors, it is possible that George did not die from police brutality, and actually succumbed to whatever disease, drug, etc that was killing him. We haven't seen the official autopsy, but I don't think the methods used by the police could of killed Floyd. We also haven't seen footage that is able to trace the entire series of events from the point of Floyd's arrest to his death. It is possible he attempted to escape or refuse arrest and thus the restraining method was used. Furthermore, it is no doubt likely there are a few \"bad\" cops in this country, but 4 in the same place at the same time? Seems a little too unlikely that they would attempt killing him. In the end there are too many doubts for the case to be boiled down to police brutality. (why was he restrained? why did he die? etc)\nAlso, why is this considered a racist act? because it's a white on black death? What if Floyd had been a white man? Would this be considered racism? or an example of poor execution? There was no recording of slurs or racially specific abuse in this situation? As far as it seems the methods used on and the arrest of Floyd was not racially relevant.\nIn the end, we haven't seen the full story, so I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that this was an act of racist police brutality.\n#GunnConfessions10088",

    "content": "10070. Debate club member here! In response to Gunn Confessions 10061, I understand the impression that our club might not necessarily seem very welcoming. The reason a lot of us joined debate is to provide an outlet for argumentation, when eyes were previously rolled at us for arguing outside of debate. For a lot of us, it\u2019s the one place where WE can feel welcome being ourselves and expressing our opinion freely. Obviously, I don\u2019t speak for everyone in debate when I say this but I\u2019m sure it holds true for a lot of us.\nIf I argue with you, it\u2019s not because I think I\u2019m better than you or want to show off my knowledge; it\u2019s just a part of who I am. I am not trying to fit my passion of debating into other subjects, I\u2019m just an opinionated person and will not shut up for the sake of simplifying a situation. That\u2019s not to say that I have no filter; I\u2019ve just finally allowed myself to express my opinions in and outside of debate.\nDebate is also a community in which I\u2019ve found some of the most supportive people I know. I did feel pretty intimidated by the way debaters conversed when I first joined the club. But some of the best people I know are in debate. Upperclassmen sacrifices their Friday afternoons to help me and other novices when we were freshmen and I have made close friends who helped me through some very tough times. With regard to the argumentative culture that many outsiders may find off-putting,I now realize that a lot of it is because we feel comfortable with each other and comfortable with expressing our opinions; it\u2019s a sign of a close-knit community that encourages self-confidence.\nOnce again, I\u2019m not trying to discredit 10061\u2019s opinion, but I hope you understand that debating outside of our club isn\u2019t something a lot of us can (or even want to) hold back, and it\u2019s not something done with the intention of making others feel inferior. I didn\u2019t write this with the intention to argue with you, I wrote it so you can understand it from our perspective. Debate is a place to express opinions freely, which is why this might carry forward into other parts of life. This club is inarguably one of the most welcoming communities I\u2019ve ever had the privilege to be a part of, and a lot of it comes from honesty that may otherwise be interpreted as annoying argumentation.\n#GunnConfessions10070",

I'm sure and I know that there are a lot of really nice people on say, debate, but as an outsider, I've never got the impression that it was an entirely welcoming community? I'm sorry if this hurts some people, but this is how I've felt about debate at Gunn.\nWhenever I've had a disagreement in a separate class with someone from debate, they always seem to turn it into a formal debate. I get it, this is your passion, and you enjoy this. I have passions to, and I bring them up every chance I can get. However, I just want to do the history project you know? I'm also not trying to say stop doing this. That's up to you. But maybe I can bring awareness to it if some people are unaware?\nPersonally, I am generally a more externally slow thinker. Because of how my brain works, I process more internally, and take my time to come to a decision before speaking. As a result, in a quick debate, I wouldn't do well (one reason I haven't joined). I'm not criticizing you for who you are. I think it's an incredible gift/talent to be able to think quickly. However, as someone who doesn't possess this ability, when every disagreement gets turned into a debate where I am unable to keep up, it constantly makes me feel like an idiot. Sometimes i feel like the other person is more trying to win the argument they blew out of proportion than actually try to figure out the best way to do the project.\nThe unfortunate result of this is that to people like me, debate seems like a very competitive community, and the people in it don't seem to be the type I would want to hang out with. I get that perhaps in debate you would want to well, debate, but outside in a classroom setting it can come across as well, arrogant? Show-offy?\nLastly, before I stop this ranting, I am aware that this is a VERY broad generalization. I know that there is not just one type of person in debate. I am also aware that there are many amazing and kind people in debate (I am friends with a few). I once again apologize if my impressions are entirely unfounded and hurt people. This is just what I see when I look at the debate team. Hopefully this can bring a new/strengthen an existing perspective to the discussion.\n[#GunnComnfessions10048]\n#GunnConfessions10061",

Find your own passion and join that club--not only is it easier to get a leadership position, you'll also find people that are interested in the concept and not just awards as a whole. Even if debate is your passion, consider joining another club like the Chariot which is still political but easier to get a position of power in. Don't waste your life on big clubs when you often won't be able to reap the benefits of the work you've put in, especially because a lot are extraordinarily biased and honestly very cliquey (including the advisors).\n#GunnConfessions10048",

But that doesn't mean that someone whose parents were refugees from Vietnam shouldn't receive affirmative action compared to someone whose parents are wealthy Nigerian doctors. Affluence has a much larger bearing on the adversity people go through in life. That's the main thing affirmative action should be trying to equalize.\nWhy does the term POC even exist? If Asian-Americans shouldn't be part of the narrative in affirmative action, if they tend to have more income, education, and status than white people (long considered the status quo), then why is being POC like some badge of honor that means you've had a difficult time being successful? Why do people use a term that erases unique cultural identities - like taking all the world's flags and making them one gray blur - and summarizes all of race relations as \"white people vs. everyone else\"? I would appreciate more nuance in how race politics are approached in America (particularly on the left.) I feel like the more \"woke\" identity politics become, the more individual struggles are ignored in favor of a broad \"all x people are inherently worse off\" narrative.\nI am ready to be disagreed with. I have no idea why this idea is so compelling to people (besides the desire to help those in need. As if basing college admissions on skin color will do that.)\n[#GunnConfessions9837]\n#GunnConfessions9852",

[2020] to 9844 -\nHi, so losing weight can be great but it can also be very dangerous.\nI'll first answer your question - it is likely that most of the weight you lost is water weight, meaning that you didn't actually lose one pound in one day, because I am pretty sure it is impossible.\nLosing weight fast is unhealthy for a number of reasons: first, it probably means that you adopted unhealthy eating habits, which either won't last for long because the headaches, nausea, exhaustion, dizziness, inability to focus or think about anything but food, which are all related to a too low blood pressure which can be dangerous for your heart in the long term, and constant hunger will lead you to start eating again, possibly even more than you used to. The other reason is that without doing it gradually you will probably not have time to get used to your new healthier or slightly reduced meals which will prevent you from building healthy eating habits in the future, and can even lead do an eating disorder or depression, etc.\nYou most likely won't pass out even if you fasted for a whole day, but if you are starving yourself for months and exercise extensively there is a good chance that one day it will be too much and you will pass out, but please, please do not let it get there.\nIf you want to lose weight I recommend talking to your parents or guardians about it. They might not like the idea at first, but don't let that scare you - you should be open and explain why you want to lose weight, and maybe set a reasonable goal (although it doesn't necessarily have to be a number, it can also be in terms of what you want your meals to look like). The next step would be meeting with a doctor and a nutritionist, and I would also recommend meeting at least once with a therapist.\nIf your parents are not supportive, try to schedule a meeting with a nutritionist yourself. You can also try to talk with your friends for moral support :)\nI think that what I am trying to say is - do not do it alone.\nGood luck!\n[#GunnConfessions9844]\n#GunnConfessions9846",

    "content": "9740. @9732 I know legacy is kind of a sensitive topic, so if reading about it bothers you, I recommend skipping this post. I have legacy at two schools. My aunt also went to MIT, where legacy doesn't matter (and I didn't get in.) No shocker there. At the first school, I didn't get in. That stung for a bit, but because it wasn't one of my top choices, it didn't bother me for too long. With the second school, I'm sure legacy was considered in my application. My family has like 14 people who went there and donated a great deal in the school's early history. But I still think I would have gotten in on my own merits. Numbers-wise I was far above 75th percentile, and I wrote some pretty strong essays. I know having that degree of legacy is a gift, and one I'm very grateful for. But I'm happier with the school I chose (more intimate, more academically rigorous, great programs in my interests, less politically volatile, won't need to awkwardly laugh it off when they're like \"hey that building has your last name!\") So someone else has my spot now, maybe someone without the advantages I had. (If anyone knows who I am based on that description, please don't dox me. You can message me privately and ask about it, if you want.) The way I see it, legacy is separate from how hard you work in school. Legacy just is - there's no reason to be proud of it or ashamed of it. If you have the skills to hack it at your intended college, then you deserve your spot. Because ultimately, it's less about who did the best on high school tests and got the most awards, and more about who will take the best advantage of their college experience. There's no way to predict the future. Admissions tries, but they do an imperfect job. I think if I had legacy at HYPSM (or other very competitive institutions) and got in, I'd have more mixed feelings, because those schools have such low admissions rates that qualified candidates get rejected for all sorts of bogus reasons. If legacy is the tipping point for your application, I could understand feelings of guilt. But the way I see it, getting in for a bogus reason is no worse than being rejected for bogus reasons. Rather than blame the student for something beyond their control, why not make it so that getting into the top 10-20 schools isn't seen as necessary for a good future? Why not emphasize a school's fit and unique programs over their prestige? Why not call it unhealthy when a parent expresses disappointment over their child not getting into a certain college, because they didn't game the system well enough? Not everyone who did well at Gunn is going to be filthy rich, powerful or famous. In fact, most people who go to top schools aren't any of those things. They're just normal people who were educated at places with a lot of history. [#GunnConfessions9732] #GunnConfessions9740",

    "content": "9657. [2019] I\u2019m a college student and there\u2019s something important I need to tell all Gunn students.\nTHERE IS NO STATE MANDATE FOR THE SELF PROGRAM\nHow do I know this? I go to college in California, and 90% of the people I talk to who went to high school in California never heard of SELF before. The 10% who have are from the Bay Area, and most of them know it from one of their friends.\nThe admin is lying to you. They want to maintain their own power and pretend that they\u2019re doing something to protect your mental health. This is to please the school board and superintendent which in turn pleases your parents into voting for the school board. So long as your parents are na\u00efve enough to believe that SELF helps students, the power structure will not change.\nThe admin won\u2019t admit they\u2019re lying to you because if they do, they\u2019ll be admitting a mistake on their part. Power hungry, authoritarian individuals never admit fault or mistakes. This is why the modern Chinese government still refuses to admit their role in the Great Chinese Famine. They don\u2019t want the public to think that the communist party was ever at fault.\nIf you don\u2019t believe that the admin is lying, you should personally demand for see a written order or piece of legislation from the governor, CA department of education, or California state legislature that directly orders the creation of SELF in schools. I dare you to do this. The admin won\u2019t be able to find it because a statewide mandate doesn\u2019t exist. In fact, you should be pushing for your school board representatives to do everything in their power to get to the bottom of this.\nI think SELF MIGHT be mandated by the school board, in which case the board could easily overturn their decision with enough pressure from the public. OR SELF is mandated by the admin in which case they can be easily replaced with enough opposition.\nI\u2019m sick and tired of people lying and disrespecting high schoolers. Everyone thinks that you\u2019re dumber than you actually are. It is absolutely insane to see the difference in respect adults have for me in college versus in high school. Our school\u2019s president and academic senate stands up for the rights of students. Our president apologizes when he\u2019s wrong and never lies to us. This is the kind of admirable leadership that we fought for through strikes, petitions, and votes. You guys seriously need to stand up and fight. People will not respect you until you do. Strike against SELF and demand transparency from the admin.\nAnd stop automatically assuming that whatever the admin says is the truth. You\u2019re taught in science and history to critically think and analyze information, but once the admin says something, you automatically assume it\u2019s true? Break out of this mindset. People in positions of power can and will lie. You need to call them out on their bullshit when it happens.\n#GunnConfessions9657",

And it makes me feel like shit because not only am I no longer good enough for him, she's so much more enough that he's okay letting everyone know about her and not me.

Now i\u2019m not saying that China did everything right, of course not, they also covered things up and ignored the problem at the beginnng. However, they did eventually pull it together and built 16 hospitals to treat people, the last of which just closed because they\u2019ve actually CONTAINED THE VIRUS. Look at South Korea, they\u2019ve got a less than 1% mortality rate because they took full preventative measures. So don\u2019t come lecturing me that I need to \u201ctoughen up\u201d or whatever the fuck because what definitely doesn\u2019t help an issue like this is people blaming a literal natural occurrence of a virus on an entire race of people. there have been a significant increase of hate crimes against asian people since the virus began, and it\u2019s not a coincidence. Yes, a lot of Chinese in the area support trump. that doesn\u2019t negate the people who have been unfairly discriminated against and hurt because of the ignorant, racist people who can\u2019t understand that they shouldn\u2019t be blaming people, they should just shut up and stay inside so it stops spreading. So I\u2019m sorry you are having a hard time facing the facts, but there it is. Racists are using this as an excuse to inact their prejudice against people who have done nothing wrong.

As someone who uses school as a distraction from my home life, this isn\u2019t just about me missing out on prom or seeing Romeo and Juliet or possibly graduating, but trust me I feel each of those losses too. It\u2019s about every mental aspect of school; having a purpose to my day is so incredibly important. Having a reason to get ready in the morning, to like how I look. Seeing people in classes I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call my friend, but I could make a silly joke to every now and then, that\u2019s gone. I want to be learning. But I\u2019ve barely had the intrinsic motivation to live the past few years, much less do flexible online learning.\nOutside of that, I could and have called my friends, but I know both that my mood won\u2019t do them any good, and that I wouldn\u2019t want to see them being productive if it meant leaving me in the dust. That\u2019s an incredibly selfish way to put that and I wish I could change it. But. Also, what would we talk about besides what\u2019s happening in the world right now? Every moment I\u2019m awake, I spend thinking about how next I\u2019m going to get food to feed my family, how we\u2019ll stretch the money I\u2019m not making right now, how to make my mom see the sunlight for once, have some light exposure therapy. How I can\u2019t tell anyone because my problems don\u2019t compare to the fact that they\u2019re \u201cmissing prom.\u201d I\u2019m living day to day. And I don\u2019t really need the advice of my friends, lovely as they are, sitting in their kushy homes, complaining about everything that got taken away from them.\nThis week I got accepted to my top school. I haven\u2019t told anyone. I\u2019m immunocompromised and I completely understand the value of flattening the curve. But I\u2019m in a valley. A violent drop from the content, king-of-the-hill living that was the beginning of my senior year. And I can\u2019t fucking wait for it to go back up.\n#GunnConfessions9573",

As the corona virus case increases, the number of racist actions towards Asians are increasing as well. I saw too many videos of asians just getting humiliated in public, people shouting racial slurs to asians, and committing violence to them. I have experienced quite similar stuff in the local grocery store and I feel absolutely disgusted and horrible. It made me sick. Please. Share this issue with a lot of people and the mainstream media is not doing a good job of covering this issue. We can at least discuss about it and make it more prominent. I really hope no one, not only Asians, get humiliated like this. I\u2019m sorry if this post was mostly about racism against Asians, but this corona virus panic and using those \u201cfear\u201d justification is becoming insane. The number of attempted violence and public harassment is increasing by days and it is extremely sad to see that not many people are aware of this or even considering the fact that there are people out there being treated like trash. It is absolutely upsetting. I really wanted to address this issue as I want this to stop occurring. Thank you for reading this long post and I really hope you check out this link: https://twitter.com/KALONSMERALDO/status/1235429090745896960?s=20\n^warning: It contains violence. If this triggers you, please don\u2019t see. But I really hope many people take a look.\n#GunnConfessions9393",

[2020] Unpopular opinion: people are against homosexuality because of their religion should not be attacked.\nImagine this:\nYou identify with a certain religion, which may have a holy book. You align your moral code with this book, read it constantly, live by it. You put your faith in this religion, the community that has supported you for years, and this sacred book. Faced with the most difficult decisions, the most difficult topics, you turn to religion to guide you. And is LGBTQ+ a [~~relatively~~] new topic? Yes. So you listen to your religious leaders, meditate over this book.\nI guess I'm trying to say that if you put 100% of your faith into a religion, would you choose unconditional acceptance or your religion? If you choose unconditional acceptance, then did you really put all of your faith into this religion? But if you choose your religion, then what happens to unconditional acceptance?\nI am not at all saying that it is okay to use religion as an excuse to be prejudiced or to discriminate. I am saying that if any of us were religious people, perhaps our choice to accept homosexuality is at odds with our choice to follow our religion--a very difficult choice indeed.\nWould love to hear opposing arguments.\n#GunnConfessions9391",

Now it wasn\u2019t super loud, but it was very distracting, and I mean it\u2019s a public place right? So I said, politely, and this is a quote of what I said, \u201cExcuse me, sir, would you mind turning the music down?\u201d And first he said \u201cI\u2019m deaf, if you don\u2019t like it, you leave. Leave.\u201d This was said super rudely. I guess this is where I could have reacted by saying something like \u201csorry\u201d, and turned away. But I was very confused by the tone of this man, and kinda dumbstruck. Then he started yelling, \u201cDo you have ID? Let me see ID\u201d. And \u201cI\u2019m the master here\u201d. And he kept shouting those two things. And then the entire coffee shop was looking, and people tried to intervene but that somehow made it worse. I don\u2019t know. Tell me that he would have still felt like he could yell at me if I weren\u2019t a young woman. I get that, unlike last time, this isn\u2019t a big deal, and that this might not even be related to gender, but oh my god all I want to do is sit in a coffee shop and work is that too much to ask for??\n#GunnConfessions9105",

    "content": "9044. [Important Message for Valentine\u2019s Day ] This is super controversial and people are likely gonna be super mad at me for saying this but I feel like it needs to be said.\nWith Valentine\u2019s Day coming up some of you need to stop being so thirsty. You don\u2019t need a relationship to be happy and thinking that you do will make you more depressed. A lot of people get into relationships when they\u2019re not socially, emotionally, or physically ready for one and it will hurt them in the long run.\nIf you\u2019re attractive (if someone has confessed feelings for you ever in your life you\u2019re attractive) or even an average looking girl then it may be easy for you to find someone on Valentine\u2019s Day. Just because you could be in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean that you should. You might not be socially or emotionally mature enough for one, and it might make sense to wait even if you don\u2019t want to at this moment. I\u2019ve seen so many friends and classmates go through terrible relationships because they were incompatible but both very attractive. I\u2019ve seen friends who date or fuck in an attempt to remove some form of trauma. You need to learn that dating isn\u2019t going to solve your emotional or social problems. Being in a romantic or sexual relationship won\u2019t necessarily make you happier in the long run, and if you\u2019re not mature enough it could actually make you very depressed when you get dumped or have to break up with someone. Other people can help, but only you can make yourself happy.\nIf you\u2019re ugly, you need the face that reality and understand that life isn\u2019t fair. People can and do judge you based on your looks first and your personality second. You can\u2019t control your race, the size of certain body parts, or your height. You can\u2019t change society\u2019s perception or expectations of beauty. You can\u2019t expect someone else to like you. You do not \u201cdeserve\u201d romantic love. And you might never find love, but you can still find happiness. Learn to take care of yourself and be happy with who you are. Find out what you like to do and go do it. Figure out what your personality is and how you want to live your life. This will make you happy with who you are, and it\u2019ll give you a way to be happy while you\u2019re alone. Once you actually have a personality, find people who have similar personalities, hobbies, and interests. Spend time with them and make new friends. Only when you reach this stage will you be socially and emotionally ready for a relationship. Granted, society is fucked up and you might not ever get a chance, but suck it up buttercup, life isn\u2019t fair. You can still be happy with your friends and hobbies which is why it\u2019s so important for you to learn to be happy alone and with friends before even trying to get into a relationship.\nIf you\u2019re struggling alone right now and you feel ugly and unwanted, I get it. I\u2019ve been there. I know you might desperately want a relationship. But the solution isn\u2019t trying to run when you haven\u2019t even learned to crawl.\nIt took me a long time to understand this but now that I do I\u2019m much happier with my life. No I\u2019m still not dating anyone, but I am very content with myself and my friends now. And I think that\u2019s far more important than any potential relationship I\u2019ll ever be in.\n#GunnConfessions9044",

[2021] You can bet I've never experienced racism, but surely you can understand that to somebody who was born way after slavery was abolished, all I work with is what I experience, and what I experience is the media and apparently you saying meh, racism against white people is moderately okay because those poor black people (#emotional) suffered so much and still suffer sometimes today. I don't find it fair that I am associated to ill intent because of something that happened 155 years ago, way before I was born, because of the color of my skin. I am not responsible for what happened back then, and the law has COMPLETLY fixed this. Don't give me that bullshit that \"yeah but the feeling still lingers and you wouldn't understand if you were black\", because that's a problem with a select few people being assholes, not a systematic problem. The only time when that lingering toxicity excuse would have been relevant would be ~60 years ago when some people who owned slaves might still have been alive. Black people have the exact same rights as white people, and the liberal media likes to focus on the cases when a black person was oppressed modern day at the hands of an unlawful officer or something like that when the fact of the matter is that that officer does not represent the white race, and it does not happen as often as the liberals make you want to think.\nI am fully aware that what happened 155 years ago and the cases of racism that still occur today are terrible, but it was the individual who was racist, not the race. Your mindset now is the exact same reason some people today associate black people with crime and drugs, because some large cases happened to have a black person involved, and the stupid human race likes to generalize and say oh that guy represents the whole race. This. mindset. is. fucking. racist! (and it goes both ways!)\nI am not saying racism isn't a problem still today, but it isn't because of slavery or history, its because some people are just assholes, and that happens all the time and is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things",

I'm finally a senior and I did not pay over a hundred dollars to have to park in the very back of the lot because of stupid juniors who think they can get away with parking without a pass. Someday the popo gonna GET YOU",

They still participate in tournaments but aren\u2019t as good as the Five Gods.\neSports also have professional clans, like FaZe, Cloud 9, or OpTiC, just like real sports teams.\nYes, the athletes aren\u2019t physically moving but they still have to be really good to get to where they are and it still takes a lot of skill to be that good.\neSports are real sports, people!",

Telling my brother not to grow up like me ruined my whole day and I hope you're happy about that. You know how much I have suffered? Well you don't know, you don't know much mental trauma I have to go through everyday. Everyday I have to tell myself I'm a good person. Everyday I try to better myself by respecting people and improving my cons. I get mad at myself for shit I done in the past but I forgive myself because I'm a better person now. I been abused by several people for more than 5 fucking years. I don't tell this to anyone anymore because I forgave them. It's hard for someone who had been kicked punched gossiped plates thrown at them judged to forgive people. I been judged by how I look and I look at the mirror everyday and take pictures of my face everyday to prove to myself I'm not ugly. I been doing this for years now. I changed my appearance just so I could see who really respects me and it works because tons of people judge me for it and now I know who to trust and who not too. Because there's a shit ton of fake people in this world and now I know who they are. Last year I got cuts all over my body and my forehead from fights with someone and coming back and being treated the same way but emotionally is fucked up. You don't know how many people I had to protect because they hurt me. I don't Judge anyone because I know how it feels to be fucking judged. I'm not telling a quarter of what I been through. I try to be kind to everyone because I just know how it fucking feels to be in the lowest of the fucking sewer. Being misplaced in a. special education to cover up my bad grades from physical and mental abuse sucks ass but oh well. I hope you're happy now you ruined my day. I know this is what you want. But if you come near me I'll fuck you up. But of course I won't because I'll see myself in you. A insecure asshole. Something of the past. I got my laptop broken by someone I got my forehead slashed by them. I had cuts and bruises all over my body. I want my brother to better himself and you come and tell him not to be like me. Of course I don't want him to be like me I don't want him to go through what I went though but I want him to respect others and work hard and believe in himself. and man I just don't know why you would say that to me. You seemed friendly but hey people change all the time so you're probably going through shit too. I know you probably think I'm a loser because of rumors and shit but hey if you want to know me talk to me. Don't avoid me and then talk to others about me. That's some weak shit I used to do that all the fucking time. Come and talk to me in real life. Tell me how messed up I am and why I'm such a loser and look into my fucking eyes motherfucker. I used to cry myself everyday because I couldn't sleep because of all the physical abuse and all the rumors. I know I'm not perfect I used to do things that hurt other people and I didn't realize what I did until later and I beat myself over these things all the time.But I too forgive myself otherwise I will never become better. But I just want to let you know those words hurt me so much because I been trying to improve myself for a long time now. I'm a better person now, I respect others even if they hate me for my past. I don't expect an apology though because well I'm not sure if you care. You can lie to me and say it was a joke but motherfucker you're lying to yourself, I know you don't like me. I know when people smile at me with their eyes wide open they're judging.",

[2020] PLEASE READ: STANDARDS-BASED GRADING\nTLDR; come to the Board meeting tomorrow to speak up about your opinions on removing homework as a part of your final grade for a class or comments on Standards-Based Grading as a whole. Meeting is at 25 Churchill Avenue. Discussion will probably begin around 8 PM.\nThe upcoming School Board meeting this Tuesday (1/14) is an important one. The Board will have a discussion on amending Board Policy pertaining to Grading and Evaluation of Student Achievement. This paragraph will be added to the current document:\n\"A teacher shall base a student's grades solely on the quality of the student's academic work and his/her mastery of course content based on district standards. Students shall have the opportunity to demonstrate this mastery through a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, tests, projects, portfolios, and/or class discussion as appropriate. Other elements that are not a direct measure of knowledge and understanding of course content, such as attendance, effort, student conduct, and work habits, shall not be factored into the academic grade but may be reported separately.\"\nI believe this new grading policy is a precursor to the implementation of Standards-Based Grading where academic and behavioral aspects of learning are separated and behavioral aspects will no longer be factored into your final grade. While not explicitly stately, through my conversation with administrators, homework would be considered a behavioral aspect of learning. Effectively, this amendment to Board Policy allows the Board to remove homework as a factor into academic grades.\nRead the entire document here: https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/pausd/Board.nsf/files/BKNTMJ749F07/$file/20200114BP5121GradesEvaluationOfStudentAchievementPROPOSED.pdf\nIf you have any opinions about this change that will impact thousands of middle and high schools students in the future (you should!), PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE come to tomorrow's Board meeting to share it. One or two students giving speeches will not be enough for Board members to realize the gravity of this change.\nTime: Jan. 14; Board meeting starts at 6:30 PM. However, I expect the Board to reach this agenda item around 8 PM. I'll keep everyone updated.\nLocation: 25 Churchill Avenue (main meeting room in the right side of the district office)\n--Claire Cheng\nclairecheng02@gmail.com",

Both Marxism and conservatism are uncommon views in this area, and as a result, members of both groups often downplay their political beliefs in public. Also, you called conservatives \"blind to the actual reality of things,\" which is comparable to someone saying, \"Democrats need to open their eyes!\" [8607. [2021] The amount of people who say that \"Gunn is so left-wing I'm hashtag oppressed for being a conservative uwu\" are just so blind to the actual reality of things. Like I don't know how to tell you this, but conservatives have never been radical or against the status quo. They want preservation of old and outdated ideals. I always tell people that I'm a \"democratic socialist\" to avoid people automatically assuming that I'm a USSR-worshipping tankie by saying that I'm a Marxist. Also, please learn that Marxism encompasses a wide variety of ideologies (I align most closely with anarcho-syndicalism).]",

Almost every 10th grader knows that he acts as though he were deemed chief chemistry teacher by the almighty himself. He is sure that he is the paladin of education, swearing to his sacred \u201clife teachings\u201d beyond all limits of objective evaluation. It seems he is entirely unaware of his questionable egotism--blaming students\u2019 difficulties with the class not on his endless hours of lecturing about the vain imaginary student, \u2018your friend\u2019, but instead projecting the qualities of \u2018your friend\u2019 onto them as the reason for their struggle. The rallying against \u2018your friend\u2019 ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy, for when students display even the slightest complaint against his class, he sees them as \u2018your friend\u2019s, degrading them to mere grade-grabbers and not true learners of conceptual O\u2019Connell\u2122 philosophy. Still, in his unawareness of himself, when students end up having to study hours outside of class, he deems his class and teaching style a great success.\n^I wrote this meme-y paragraph while I still had OC. My perception of him has changed a lot actually since I wrote it, he is actually a really nice guy\nChem1 gang G period!!!",

    "content": "7892. I really dislike SELF, and I know a lot of people do too.\nIt s a waste of 50 minutes, learning about something that should be applied in our lives, however, it is either something we've already learned in our life, or it's something too naive and simplified to be work in reality.\nAnd it's really funny how they always talk about relieving stress from students when really SELF is just taking away time people have to either study or to just hangout with their friends.\nLike, okay Gunn.\nThank you for making my life so much easier and stress free!\nBut that's not my only issue with SELF.\nIt's the fact that, as someone who's going through depression, and has friend and family issues, a lot of the topics brought up in SELF are triggering for me. And when they portray it as something super two dimensional and fixable, and when they say it's a big deal but act like it's not, it hurts.\nA lot.\nBut it's not like I can just get up and leave or get mad or show my emotions because then people will know and my SELF teach will be like, \"Omg, share you situation and we can dissect is and figure it out together!!\"\nI have never met teachers with lower EQ than that.\nLike maybe you're okay with sharing your problems, but I'm not.\nAnd it sucks when people force you to open up. So you end up bottling it up and you feel really bad and right after is Day 3 B period, and then I have a test and I'm feeling really bad from SELF and I do bad on my test.\nLike ok.\nHelpful Gunn. Really really really helpful.\nAnd that's not my only issue with Gunn.\nIt's the fact that they portray it as such a happy, friendly, open school. Like it's got nothing to hide.\nBut needless to say, Gunn friend groups are literally set in stone. You can't get in, and if you get kicked out, the gates locked behind you.\nSo, how exactly do you make friends if you didn't have friends from middle school?\nRight, you don't.\nBig brain moments.\nSo, as someone who's only friends go to other school, it too socially awkward and mentally weak to try and find friends, when am I happy at Gunn?\nDuring FLEX when I'm playing video games with my Paly friends.\nThat's when.\nSo.\nYeah.\nGunn sucks.\nThank you for reading this you're the best we should rebel against Gunn and nobody goes to SELF because SELF is dumb and FLEX>>>>> SELF ok I'm tired bye.",

Also note that details have changed to avoid sharing specific stories, and that the goal of this post is not to give a comprehensive evaluation on Linsdell or her teaching, but rather to warn students of some of the things that could occur (and have occurred) in her classes.\n1. If you have any shortcoming that makes you deviate from being a \"good student\", expect to answer for it in front of the class. This can range from one mistake you made one day to an ongoing behavior lapse. (And it did \u2013 being a \"good student\" most of the time didn't excuse you from being singled out in front of the class on the day you forgot a pencil.) You can bet on that it won't be discussed in private or with any degree of confidentiality.\n2. She has also sometimes approached students and singled them out by asking them to represent their racial and/or ethnic identity to the class (e.g asking about a specific political event, asking if they would want to choose a project relating to their specific identity, etc)\nAgain, I'm not trying to evaluate Linsdell as a teacher, much less as a person. This post is based on the assumption that, while students deserve for these things not to happen, if they are likely to happen, students deserve to know.",

We got access to the materials only a couple weeks before the start of school, but the assignment was short (maybe 2-3 hours at most). It wasn't mandatory, only a little bit of extra credit. In terms of the content, most of it was actually review, since almost all of it was covered in analysis. I would expect either no summer assignment or a similarly short and easy one that will be released towards the start of next school year. If you want to see the summer homework from past years you can find it here: https://sites.google.com/a/pausd.org/dunbar-physics/class-b/summer-work-for-apc-physics",

In previous years, gunn theatre was extremely rude and divided, and although people have had their differences this year, no one actually hates each other as far as I\u2019m aware (which is a HUGE improvement from previous gunn theatre years) so please try to chill a little bit. Deniz and Arman have brought together Gunn Theatre in a way that no one thought was possible and have honestly and truly made it the least intimidating it has ever been! So kudos to them and please don\u2019t bring everyone down by writing stuff like this on confessions...i know that it\u2019s difficult to see the changes from a younger perspective, but two years ago, there was an actual sexual assaulter involved with theatre. In my opinion, we have vastly improved the quality of people in theatre while still managing to be welcoming to all. Nothing is perfect, but we can get as close as possible and I really think we\u2019re improving! Please just don\u2019t make generalizations like this that make everyone feel bad!\n[7147. I\u2019ve been a part of the theatre community for some time now and I have to say, it\u2019s kind of gotten bad. It\u2019s supposed to be a safe, welcoming, and supportive community, and honestly, I don\u2019t feel like it is anymore. This year it\u2019s gotten really cliquey and people are mean and judgmental and everyone talks about each other behind their backs and it\u2019s just gross. Obviously there are still a lot of awesome and supportive people in theatre, but a lot of them are mean and talk shit about people who are part of the theatre \u201cfamily\u201d which is so not what families should be like. This may be an unpopular opinion but I felt like I needed to share it.]",

    "content": "6618. @6606 First of all, most abortions not are jamming metal rods into the fetus\u2019 head. The abortion method you are probably referring to is called dilation and evacuation, however that has been banned since 2003 and only accounts for 0.2% of all abortions. Don\u2019t parenthesize \u201cthis is what happens\u201d when most of the time, it\u2019s not what happens. About 91% of all abortions in 2015 happened during the first trimester, meaning prior to the 13th week of the fetus\u2019 conception according to the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). This means most of the abortions are either vacuum aspiration, where the contents of the uterus are sucked out, or medicine-induced abortions. The abortion procedure you\u2019re referring to happens in the second trimester, and in that trimester, the mother needs consent from a doctor and it only happens IF the women needs protection according to the ruling of Roe v. Wade. However, these rules have changed and the regulations have most likely gotten stricter since the Supreme Court has gotten more conservative and are allowing regulations that contradict Roe v. Wade to slide. In the third trimester, since the fetus can survive outside of the mother, she cannot abort UNLESS her health is in serious danger. The states can say the mother can\u2019t abort since the baby now can survive without life support. So your comment on Democrats saying you can abort until birth is incorrect, because there is a ruling that says otherwise. After the first trimester, it\u2019s no longer just the woman\u2019s decision. But even so, at the end of the day, it\u2019s the woman\u2019s decision to abort. Even if abortion is illegal, the women will still do it for reasons like they aren\u2019t ready to have a child, emotionally, physically, and/or economically. Bearing that kind of responsibility changes your life forever. Even if you don\u2019t agree with abortion, I don\u2019t believe people should antagonize other people for it. It was their choice, if you had to make that choice, maybe you wouldn\u2019t make it, but they shouldn\u2019t be disrespected because they did what they thought was best.",

Yeah sometimes the class can be a bore, but if you claim to learn more from \"Wikipedia articles\" then by all means go ahead and learn from Wikipedia articles. No need to complain about a class that you signed up for. Let's be real, \"screwed up\" world views don't stem from an 11th grade history class. If someone has a certain viewpoint, not only are they entitled to it, but if it's as strong as most right-wing anti-SJW views, they will find a way to defend it. Rather than complaining about the lack of \"intellectually stimulating\" material in the lane 1 class that YOU signed up for, how about actively discussing your views with your teacher and make it stimulating. Stop pretending to be smarter than you are and blaming your issues on a class with a teacher who's probably doing the best they can? Shaming a teacher's curriculum on social media doesn't make you intelligent or bold, it makes you look and sound like a smartass.\n[5817: 5817. [2020] US History right now is honestly the worst class I have ever taken in my life. Not because it is difficult, but because it makes me lose my dignity.

It's a combination of both what your extracurriculars show and a subconscious tone that rises within your essays that is really easily shows whether you're being authentic or not.",

Obviously not all teachers are created equal, but most of them are human just like us and understand mental health difficulties since a lot of them have experienced it themselves. If a teacher isn\u2019t understanding and still thinks of you as a \u201cbad student\u201d, as I\u2019ve been told personally, its just not worth it and I\u2019d highly recommend dropping the class. <3 u dude:) good luck\n[3740.

I'm not discrediting your accomplishment at all, congratulations, but it just irritates me how you got into a school AND boast in front of your friends who most likely did not get in due to their harder major.

    "content": "9899. [2023] Don\u2019t know who wrote it, but it\u2019s spot on. Perspective: WE ARE NOT IN THE SAME BOAT ... I heard that we are all in the same boat, but it's not like that. We are in the same storm, but not in the same boat. Your ship could be shipwrecked and mine might not be. Or vice versa. For some, quarantine is optimal. A moment of reflection, of re-connection, easy in flip flops, with a cocktail or coffee. For others, this is a desperate financial & family crisis. For some that live alone they're facing endless loneliness. While for others it is peace, rest & time with their mother, father, sons & daughters. With the $600 weekly increase in unemployment some are bringing in more money to their households than they were working. Others are working more hours for less money due to pay cuts or loss in sales. Some families of 4 just received $3400 from the stimulus while other families of 4 saw $0. Some were concerned about getting a certain candy for Easter while others were concerned if there would be enough bread, milk and eggs for the weekend. Some want to go back to work because they don't qualify for unemployment and are running out of money. Others want to kill those who break the quarantine. Some are home spending 2-3 hours/day helping their child with online schooling while others are spending 2-3 hours/day to educate their children on top of a 10-12 hour workday. Some have experienced the near death of the virus, some have already lost someone from it and some are not sure if their loved ones are going to make it. Others don't believe this is a big deal. Some have faith in God and expect miracles during this 2020. Others say the worst is yet to come. So, friends, we are not in the same boat. We are going through a time when our perceptions and needs are completely different. Each of us will emerge, in our own way, from this storm. It is very important to see beyond what is seen at first glance. Not just looking, actually seeing. We are all on different ships during this storm experiencing a very different journey. Realize that and be kind. Unknown Author #GunnConfessions9899",

I get flashbacks all the fucking time. The SSRIs I'm getting prescribed aren't doing shit. I saw the Shawshank Redemption for the first time in a while and that movie totally fucked me up, if I were in CA, I would just smoke some weed to help stop the flashback, it works every time. People need to understand that some people use weed for medical effects, and yeah, Asian parents don't respect that at all. Nothing else works for me, my psychiatrist has been putting me on different meds trying to find one that works. I hate my Mom, the shit she did to me, and I hate our police (yeah, just bc you had a good experience with them doesn't mean we all do). I used to be a diehard Blue Lives Matter supporter until they fucked me over and I learnt the truth about our justice system. Everyone fucking laughs at me like I'm that druggie kid who gets kicked out always, like yeah, great, you don't have to deal with using a substance which is still a Schedule 1 narcotic. Good for you that you at least have I family, I don't have shit anymore. I'm just counting down the days until I turn 18 and I can finally get my medical marijuana card. #GunnConfessions9876",

    "content": "9835. Parents who were complaining about the grading system (credit/no credit). I get that you may feel like you want to show your improvement through your grades, I am a straight A\u2019s student and always strive for the best, but it\u2019s not equitable to our community. There are kids who get lunches at school because their parents can\u2019t afford the food. How do you think they are handling this situation? There are kids who don\u2019t have fancy computers or unlimited data or even WiFi! So please just think about more than yourself during this time. Not everything is about you and your grades. My mom helps out in a kindergarten and first grade classroom four days a week. There\u2019s one little girl in the class whose only devices at home that have cellular access are her mother and big sisters phone. How is she supposed to go to zoom meetings or see her teacher or classmates let alone do the work?! There are many kids in our district who live like that \u2014 all ages and grades. It\u2019s not fair to complain about yourself not getting a letter grade when you have three full meals a day and access to the internet with out any trouble. Think about the kids and families around us who are struggling right now. Think about the people in our community who aren\u2019t as privileged as some and how we can help them. Getting fricking letter grades isn\u2019t going to do that. Colleges don\u2019t care if you only have credit on your transcript, colleges are accepting credit/no credit on transcripts because, believe it or not they are dealing with the whole coronavirus thing too!! The whole country, really the whole world is facing this pandemic so stop freaking out about a fricking letter grade. What really disappoints me is that here in Palo Alto, a very progressive town with abundant resources has people who are flipping out about their child not getting a grade in their AP or honors class. It bothers me that in a society where we are accepting of all people, we are too thickheaded to see past a stupid grade, to the people who need the support. I appreciate all of the teachers who are doing their best to give everyone the best learning experience during this time and everything our district is trying to do for our community despite what some parents are saying. Like what the hell, stop just thinking about your special ass snowflake and think about the other kids in the district. Again, I\u2019m not looking to anger anyone I just really feel the need to express this. #GunnConfessions9835",

    "content": "9825. *just something I wanted to share with you guys* Talk To Us During these hard times staying positive and looking at the bright side is important. But ignoring the downside is where mistakes are made and we lose touch with reality. It has now been a month since the \u201cshelter-in place\u201d order was enforced. During this time, PAUSD has completely halted all mandatory education including assignments, lectures, and any other content. But ever since it was announced school will not be reopening this school year, somehow it feels like no communication has been made with the students that actually attend these schools. As a sophomore at Gunn, neither the school nor the district communicated with us, the students. Many crucial events are coming up that have not been addressed. And the topics addressed by the district were done through a one-sided platform addressed by someone that knows nothing about us or our values. One main topic PAUSD has worked on was implementing the \u201ccredit/no credit\u201d system which allows students to get credit for a class without receiving a letter grade which would have affected their GPA. This alone is a good thing, but the district has repeatedly referred to the decision describing it with \u201cno downsides\u201d which only shows the lack of conversation happening between the district and the high school students affected. The \u201ccredit/no credit\u201d system has a substantial downside, it takes away from the students who worked extremely hard this semester to bring their GPA up for it not to count. In addition, students taking AP courses also wish to benefit from the weighted GPA score which is also non-existent due to this system. These may seem like simple issues to the principals, admin, and district but for us this completely altered how we viewed our high school experience let alone our future. Secondly, there are many issues brought up by students that have been repeatedly ignored and pushed aside. One of the most frustrating responses to hear from the admin and district is \u201cmore information to come\u201d, this simply is another way to push us aside including our opinions and values. Our lives keep moving, we keep getting closer to finals week, summer school, summer jobs, and starting a new year yet we don\u2019t even know if these things are happening. Summer school is so important for so many students, we plan it years in advance, arrange all four summers around it, and wake up at 6:00AM to sign up just to be pushed aside and ignored. This school district was created to educate and guide us but somehow when we are struggling the most they decide to ignore us. #GunnConfessions9825",

In his webinar he talked about how there \"no downsides to credit/ no credit\" which is just arrogant. I get that it could be worse, but there are so many students taking APs to boost their GPA that is now all for nothing. He also thinks that we actually have zoom classes with our teachers other than office hours. The teachers take HOURS to respond to emails while we just get stuck and have no one answering our questions. Don't get me wrong, I love my teachers, but I think they do WAY less work than they would do during school pre closure... I just think the district should start paying attention to what actually goes on and not just what they hope to... Sorry if you don't agree #GunnConfessions9823",

But I felt like I changed too much and it just felt kind of sad because you don't really reconnect and the conversation went from excited to awkward and it was sad knowing we can't have that \"friendship\" experience anymore. probably this is just me though because I changed from really positive to negative in high school.

I\u2019m in AP Physics 1. It was one of those exploration assignments that you do to get a conceptual feel for a topic before actually being taught on the subject. This kind of assignment can be really fun and helpful, but the exploration asked for the most unreasonably in-depth stuff. For example, one part was talking about rubbing a balloon on ur head and the way the hair sticks to the balloon. And it said to draw a diagram of the set up, the forces involved, and the movement of the subatomic particles. But, uh, the subject hasn\u2019t been taught, idk where the subatomic particles are (we have never once discussed subatomic particles in this class). It does not benefit me to spend my time making up a bs diagram when I simply do not have the information to make an educated guess. Plus, making incorrect guesses could lead me to creating memories of false info instead of helping me practice and conceptualize the correct info. So basically - I feel ur pain; it should not be this hard. It\u2019s so frustrating to have to waste such a significant amount of my time trying to figure out how to do pointless assignments in order to pass the class and then have to learn everything on my own. The physics department really needs to get their shit together. [#GunnConfessions9799] #GunnConfessions9800",

    "content": "9799. [2020] to 9777 - Hi, I have struggled with eating disorders since I was 12.5, and I'm 18 now, so you can do the math... I hid my ED until I was 14, and even when my parents found out about it I wouldn't admit I had an eating disorder. You would think that after five and a half years I would get used to it, the struggle with food, starving myself and then binge eating, and the cycle repeats. When my parents found out I had an eating disorder, I was already anorexic. I couldn't leave the house for months, because even taking a walk might cause my heart to work too hard, and the danger of being anorexic is that your hurt will stop. I am so proud of you for admitting to yourself that you need help. I didn't tell my friends about my ED until this year, and except my parents and my siblings very few people in my family know. I was so, so ashamed. But I needed help. I still do. Get the help. Talk to your friends, to your parents. Not hiding the ED, not having to pretend like it's not hard for you to eat in public or try new food or even talking or thinking about it makes it a little easier to cope with, a little more manageable. When you struggle with an ED, you need other people to help you. If there is a time to be selfish, it is now. It's your turn to think about yourself and your health. Don't undermine the power of an ED, and don't wait. I still meet a therapist and a doctor for eating disorders. They are both amazing and literally saved my life (well actually I had weekly meetings with both of them until quarantine...). If you want to talk with me, or want me to refer you to one of them or both of them, please let me know (you can comment here or post another gunn confession post :)) It can get better, so don't give up. #GunnConfessions9799",

    "content": "4238. Regarding the CAASPP: Almost all mentioned positives are either lies or half-truths. Funding: Gunn does not qualify nor has ever qualified for Title I funding, the only funding affected by standardized testing participation as implemented by No Child Left Behind and the succeeding ESSA (>35% low income students). The district encouraging students to take the CAASPP is due to pressuring from the state Education Department since there is a chance that a state would lose federal funding for poor schools receiving Title I funding if they drop below 95% statewide participation. However, plenty of states have dropped to even as low as 80% and none have ever lost federal funds. There is state money associated with participation that may only be spent to negate the cost of the CAASPP. The SAO shutting down in the morning was based on divergence of funds for other purposes (Title IX oopsie) as evidenced by the PAUSD budget sheet for 2019. School Rating: As mentioned before, Gunn already has a very high score based on CAASPP results even from years with low participation. Interestingly, the year participation grew from 25% to 65%, test scores dropped from an average 97.91 to 94.8. Accreditation: There is no evidence to suggest that a high school has ever been unaccredited solely because of low state testing participation. College: CAASPP results only allow you to avoid work for California State Universities (CSU's, NOT UC's) introductory courses, most of which can be skipped by senior or junior classes at Gunn. CAASPP scores do not affect the admission process for either CSU's or UC'S, only the aforementioned skipping introductory courses for CSU's. The state did propose adding scores to admission for UC's in 2018 but the UC board of regents concluded that CAASPP scores have no correlation with student merit and would take 5-6 years to study and come to a decision. Almost all colleges do not look at the Seal of Biliteracy or the Golden State Seal of Honor as other states do not have equivalents. Raffle: Ok this one is valid but beware since some seniors have reported not receiving their prizes from last year. At the end of the day, it's your own prerogative whether you want to spend 8 hours for the CAASPP, but just be aware of the costs and benefits of your choice.",

Funding: Gunn does not qualify nor has ever qualified for Title I funding, the only funding affected by standardized testing participation as implemented by No Child Left Behind and the succeeding ESSA (>35% low income students). The district encouraging students to take the CAASPP is due to pressuring from the state Education Department since there is a chance that a state would lose federal funding for poor schools receiving Title I funding if they drop below 95% statewide participation. However, plenty of states have dropped to even as low as 80% and none have ever lost federal funds. There is state money associated with participation that may only be spent to negate the cost of the CAASPP. The SAO shutting down in the morning was based on divergence of funds for other purposes (Title IX oopsie) as evidenced by the PAUSD budget sheet for 2019. School Rating: As mentioned before, Gunn already has a very high score based on CAASPP results even from years with low participation. Interestingly, the year participation grew from 25% to 65%, test scores dropped from an average 97.91 to 94.8. Accreditation: There is no evidence to suggest that a high school has ever been unaccredited solely because of low state testing participation. College: CAASPP results only allow you to avoid work for California State Universities (CSU's, NOT UC's) introductory courses, most of which can be skipped by senior or junior classes at Gunn. CAASPP scores do not affect the admission process for either CSU's or UC'S, only the aforementioned skipping introductory courses for CSU's. The state did propose adding scores to admission for UC's in 2018 but the UC board of regents concluded that CAASPP scores have no correlation with student merit and would take 5-6 years to study and come to a decision. Almost all colleges do not look at the Seal of Biliteracy or the Golden State Seal of Honor as other states do not have equivalents. Raffle: Ok this one is valid but beware since some seniors have reported not receiving their prizes from last year. At the end of the day, it's your own prerogative whether you want to spend 8 hours for the CAASPP, but just be aware of the costs and benefits of your choice. #GunnConfessions9248",

Make sure you can see yourself having a balance of work and fun at that school. I wasted over $700 applying to schools and I only saw myself going to three or four of those schools. Not only was I wasting money and time, I was taking away someone's spot that could've made it onto the waitlist or even accepted. Because I wasn't in the right mindset in the fall, I applied to schools just because my parents/peers/teachers told me to. Also, a big tip is to look at how schools are handling the situation with covid. How are they dealing with it, does administration listen to student input, how many days did they give students before kicking them out, do they offer sufficient online tools for learning, etc. I also didn't know that if I actually tried in high school I could get decent merit based scholarships. If I understood the importance of lowering cost that would've motivated me to do better in high school.

Like I love you, you\u2019re one of my best friends, but I wish your self respect wasn\u2019t so fragile that I can\u2019t tell you the truth about why what you\u2019re doing and how you act isn\u2019t respectful or friendly. A lot of the time you make me feel worse about myself, but it\u2019s never been harder than it is now to convey this to you without sounding like I\u2019m rejecting responsibility; I recognize that how I react to you isn\u2019t your problem and I don\u2019t want to put that on you. But it doesn\u2019t make any sense to me that you\u2019d want to be my friend if you don\u2019t respect me or our relationship. But if our only method of communication is one where you feel so comfortable hanging up on me because you don\u2019t agree with my opinions, then what the fuck do you want? I can\u2019t talk to you honestly over zoom and genuinely have you understand me. I couldn\u2019t tell you in person because three weeks ago, your quirks weren\u2019t so obvious and annoying that they were ruining the moment, but they are now. I wish you weren\u2019t so selfish. I don\u2019t understand how you aren\u2019t aware of how disrespectful you act. Seriously, it genuinely boggles me that you can treat our friends the way you do but turn around and cry on my shoulder if anyone comes close to treating you the same way. How can one person be so vain and un-self-aware, yer also incredibly self depricating to the point where you make the rest of your friends feel like shit? It makes me so pissed seeing the way you treat our friends, these people I care about so much. It makes me more pissed that you seem to lack the common human decency of respect or composure. And maybe this rant blows my biggest disagreements with you out of proportion and doesn\u2019t take into account how much I care about you, but you actually fucking exhaust me. It\u2019d kill me to see you go to college and treat anyone new you meet in the same way. But I guess by then you\u2019ll stop treating me like you\u2019re my responsibility. #GunnConfessions9702",

I was hoping to boost my GPA by working super hard this semester but I should have been doing that from the start. They always told you 'dont buy in' to the toxic culture of Gunn. Only take honors/AP classes if you are 'passionate' about it. Top colleges are false idols that you shouldn't worry about. But where has that left me? In the competitive world of Gunn, I don't have top grades. I didn't take nearly as many 'rigorous' classes as my peers. Other students challenged themselves with flagship clubs like Business, MUN, Debate, but not I. I didn't do sports. I didn't face any hardship. My dad has a good job, I had so many opportunities available that I didn't take. I was just too lazy. Why was I like this???!??!?!? #GunnConfessions9648",

I\u2019ll also be including other genres for anyone else interested :) For the sake of non being repetitive, I\u2019m not going to mention the big ones, like Black Clover, My Hero Academia, Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, Demon Slayer, etc. Those have probably been mentioned as some point or another. If you want a summary of any of these anime, go to My Anime List and look them up. With that being said, anime list! Overlord \u2014 this one\u2019s kinda similar to One Punch Man in the sense that it\u2019s a satire of OP characters. It also just generally has really interesting and unique characters. Genre: Action, Comedy, Isekai, Fantasy That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime \u2014 also has a diversity of characters and an OP main character. And his slime form is really cute. Genre: Action, Comedy, Fantasy, Isekai Assassination Classroom \u2014 less about action and a lot more about how classmates interact with each other and their teachers. Even still, Koro-Sensei is really OP and so is Nagisa to some extent. Genre: Comedy, Action, School Akatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn) \u2014 it\u2019s an action... with a female lead! This one\u2019s another one of my favorites, and I highly recommend watching this one. Genre: Historic, Adventure, Action Now some romance ones: Love is War \u2014 really cute. Highly recommend. Everyone is so loveable in this anime, even that one guy that\u2019s gloomy all the time. It\u2019s basically one giant satire of romance (pay attention to the narrator). Genre: Romance, School, Comedy Your Lie in April \u2014 a nice romance complete with music! Character development is really apparent and fun to see. Also the music is really good :P Genre: Music, Romance, School, Drama Acchi Kocchi \u2014 personally, I really love this one. Everyone is super cute, and there\u2019s not much drama involved: it\u2019s basically purely warm and fuzzy moments. Genre: Romance, Comedy, Slice of Life I\u2019ll do some more later if more people want it haha. [#GunnConfessions9610] #GunnConfessions9621",

    "content": "9620. [2021] pass/fail literally sucks and I think we really need to band together and talk to the Gunn admin because there ARE better solutions. Please hear me out; foothill and most other colleges have a similar system to what we are doing now except they have options, students can choose to have pass/fail or receive an actual letter grade when taking a course and we should have the same system and let students choose. Pass:fail should still be an option because some people need it, if they can\u2019t complete as much work because their family is sick or etc... but for the rest of us, having this semester of grades matters and we would rather not have pass/fail. it works for about half of Gunn students, aka the seniors who are chilling in second semester and don\u2019t need grades, and the freshman who\u2019s grades don\u2019t even matter for UCs. For the rest of us, it\u2019s a whole semester of grades that can boost your GPA missing; especially those of us who were counting on having this semester to boost it and chose our courses based on this fact. For sophomores, now they have to get great grades in junior year when they will be taking APS and much harder classes because they don\u2019t have the cushion of sophomore year grades to back them up. This is extremely unfair because they will suffer much more stress in junior year, when the majority are taking the SAT, starting to think about college, and have difficult classes. For juniors, this was their last chance to boost their GPA and get good grades and that\u2019s been unfairly taken away from them. The hard classes you took that would have affected your weighted GPA now do not and you basically took it for nothing. A whole semester is gone from the grade book. Some may say that \u2018a semester doesn\u2019t make a difference\u2019 and \u2018colleges will overlook it\u2019 but it puts us at a great a disadvantage compared to other students from other schools who are NOT doing pass/fail, (and the majority are not) and will have these grades when they are applying for college. Lets step it up and convince the admin or at least do something. #GunnConfessions9620",

A lack of structured curriculum, test preparation, and varying circumstances with home life means that grades would be very unlikely to go up, but rather more likely to go down.

Even though I am technically a second semester senior I still care a lot about school, which is why I keep going, but I am so scared to get infected and put one of my family members at risk (they can die if they get the virus). I prefer to have school in the summer at this point. My family's health is a lot more important than having a long summer break. #GunnConfessions9454",

Even if you believe that we don\u2019t care, or we were hanging out with friends, literally let us be late.... maybe we\u2019ll miss the lecture and come early next time in order to catch up. My point is, for a lot of gunn students who are usually late not because they want to, it would help if we heard something like \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here today\u201d or \u201cgood to see you\u201d when we\u2019re late.

I for one can\u2019t tell too many people I\u2019m part of this community but it\u2019s nice to be a part of something in which there are people fighting for all of our rights. Don\u2019t let her ever make u feel less than human because u have as much of a right as anyone else to be urself. She may not agree with u, but she has no say in how u live your life and if she\u2019s gonna give u shit for it, she needs to leave u alone and should be ignored. Have a great great day and I hope she realizes that, although no one can change her mind for her, sometimes it\u2019s nice to just agree to disagree and let people live how they want to :D #GunnConfessions9312",

He\u2019s also rude AF like 90% of the time. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just the way that he treats talks around his friends, but it always seems more extreme around me as if I\u2019m the unwanted person in the group. Either way he needs to learn to stfu about giving people shit for not being perfect when he himself cannot do better. This person is so unmindful when talking about their goals. They always sets goals that are pretty difficult and then openly says anybody who can\u2019t do this is trash. I\u2019m not saying that having high goals or telling people of the reality of things is bad thing. But there is a time and place for everything. Telling people that they are trash I feel like is one of the last things you wanna tell people on the same sports team as you. On a team you should be inspiring your teammates not putting them down. I\u2019ve given this person so many chances to change, but I\u2019ve had enough. If you are the person I\u2019m talking about just so you know I don\u2019t consider you a friend nearly as much as the others do. Matter of fact, when you lose your friends next year, stay the fuck away from me and my group of friends. (Sorry I just needed to vent) #GunnConfessions9305",

[2020] Ok first off I wanna say I rly rly do get what you guys are saying but I sorta wanna bring light to another perspective just so you guys know some of us have a reason for doing this. I asked for a parking permit at the beginning of the year (I\u2019m a senior) and they said they would happily put it on hold for me until I got to school because I was sick the week they were giving permits out. I got to school and they said they sold mine accidentally, and that they were sold out. At that point I was like ok, it\u2019s my senior year, i will happily take the tickets if I get to park in the lot because I have been waiting for this moment forever. So anyway, I\u2019ve paid $200 in tickets and ofc I understand your frustration, I really do, but I live much farther than half of the people at gunn and I really can\u2019t be waking up at 5:00 in the morning to go park on Georgia. It really isn\u2019t my fault that my permit was given to someone else accidentally when I was sick. I don\u2019t know... I get where you all are coming from, but I\u2019m happily paying my tickets . Ofc I park on Georgia sometimes when there are low amounts of parking spots so that people with permits can park, but do you guys get where I\u2019m coming from?? Again sorry to the people who are having issues parking with permits... I really don\u2019t know what to say at this point #GunnConfessions9298",

I definitely don\u2019t condone anybody being oppressively gay... but as far as I\u2019m aware, that does not exist at Gunn nearly as much as the reverse occurs.

It's annoying how even though most people are feminists, many of them still believe women are obligated to have children. We are not.

Every day I try to hype myself up but usually I leave class disappointed in myself for not being able to participate even once. It's not only that I'm super shy; I've experienced some pretty traumatic humiliation and now every time I raise my hand in class I can hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. It's getting close to the time when we're supposed to ask teachers for rec letters but most of my teachers can't even remember my name since I don't put myself out there that much. It honestly makes me jealous seeing my friends being besties with their teachers... I know this sounds like I'm obsessed with getting into college but I'm just concerned about my recs... Does it matter if I don't get \"shining\" rec letters from my teachers? How important are rec letters in your college app anyways?? also am i the only one feeling this way or does everyone have a teacher they\u2019re super close with... #GunnConfessions9145",

A draft is very unlikely to occur and fitness testing is just stupid to use as a point against feminism. 60% of homeless people are men and 78% of deaths by suicide are men.Women win custody 90% of the time; why do courts not believe men deserve to see thier children? How about murder rate? 77% of homicide victims are male. I can't find solid evidence for this but I know you all know this is true. Society doesn't take male claims of sexual or domestic abuse seriously. Just look at Johnny Depp's feud with Amber Heard. When she said he was the perpetrator, everyone lost thier shit. When evidence that Heard was the perpetrator and Depp was the victim, no one cared. Why? Not trying to say the women don't face issues but these important men's issues don't ever seem to be seriously addressed by anyone. Ms. Itchikawa is the one exception.

I don't know that I've genuinely heard anyone argue that outside of some extremists on Tumblr/VOX. Even if it's only a few people who hold unhealthy mindsets when it comes to race (and people of all races can do so), those mindsets are powerful and disruptive enough that they are extremely detrimental to society as a whole. If slavery had never occurred, and everyone's ancestors immigrated here of their own volition, I'd bet that race relations would not be nearly as strained as they are today. Without slavery in our past, a few assholes propagating racism would seem much more ridiculous and unprecedented. The openly racist people would be seen as borderline insane social pariahs with similar superiority complexes that the Nazis had. They wouldn't be defended as angry, misguided college students whose families are losing their jobs. Also, it's been backed over and over again with studies and personal experiences that African-Americans have a harder time getting jobs, tend to get followed around in stores and while out-and-about, get incarcerated disproportionately compared to white people committing the same crimes, etc. I don't consider going through your whole life knowing you're at a disadvantage and more likely to be arrested \"not a big deal;\" If you can overcome those disadvantages yourself, that's great, but not everyone has the mental strength/finances to do so. #GunnConfessions9038",

You have no right to speak about me like that; focusing on my physical appearance instead of my personality. My boyfriend is lucky to have me because of who I am, not how I look. Females are still being described of as their physical appearance when they are so much more. Your confessions made me feel so violated and disgusted with myself. I felt watched and considering it's Sunday when you wrote that, I know it wasn't because you had just seen me at school. I hope you know how horrible you made me feel and how frustrating it is as a female to have to still deal with this.

I've written a letter to Cathy Lawrence already, but I just wanted to spread the word about what you can do to hopefully fix this. If you look at page 56 of the student handbook (link: https://gunn.pausd.org/sites/default/files/gunn_handbook_19-20.pdf), Gunn has endorsed the \"InsideOut\" Initiative regarding sports on campus. Among other things, the initiative states that \"The program emphasizes a transformational relationship between coaches and athletes rather than a 'win at all costs' transactional relationship.\" After seeing the emails and hearing the complaints myself, it is clear that Coach Granville is in violation of this initiative. If you really want to get involved, spread the word, and tell your friends and your parents (admin will do something if parents get involved!) to email admin about your concerns. Good luck guys, track was one of my favorite parts ab Gunn and it sucks to see this happen. Sincerely, a pissed off alumni #GunnConfessions9010",

How does he expect us to improve if he doesn\u2019t let us practice. He also yells at students who are injured for missing practice (going to the trainer instead of getting more injured), and had lost his temper in front of students when yelling at Curtis multiple times. He fired two coaches who were more qualified then him and had completely ruined xc and track. #GunnConfessions9003",

That was where it all started. granville is a great and hardworking guy with great kids. People are attacking him like a mob. seriously, he loves the team. the reason he's coming down hard is because people treated him like shit, boycotting and disrespecting the team in cross county. please please please have some empathy. just think about it from his perspective from the start. he never meant it to turn out like this. he genuinely believed that it was the right thing to do to fire dylan, and then after that everyone started hating him no matter what he did. he literally couldn't win in this situation. he's not abusive. you guys have been. #GunnConfessions9001",

This is not just about his bad coaching but is more about who he is as a person. XC and Track should be a community where everyone feels respected and safe. With that being said, maybe check your reality and realize that you were fortunate enough to not have experienced an emotionally abuse by a coach whom you trusted and that you are being disrespectful towards athletes who have been crying for help to even be treated as decent human beings.",

Additionally, the email never specified which part of your body needs to be covered by the bra. So you can show off your nipples too if you wear the bra on your head or arm or something. [8966. [Gunn T&F] Last track season I had one of the best times of my life being able to compete in ccs as a sophomore was awesome all the pressure and adrenaline rush was great. Its only been 3 days into the new season. The numbers of sprinters we has dropped. We have no varsity girl sprinters and Im fairly sure we just lost the last two varsity boys sprinters. One being the most dedicated man I have ever known. He's willing to train 7 hours just to get a good practice in. Which is far beyond what CCS regulation allows. Most of the OG sprinters left for hurdles or jumps and its all cause of Granville. I dont think anyone else who wasn\u2019t in track/xc will ever be able to understand what\u2019s happening hence why the admin hasn't done anything. More than half the varsity time have complained about him and his training methods. Im already injured and its because of his over training. I was hoping for an even better season sub 50 in the 400 and go to states in the 4x4, but thats gone. I dont really have anything else besides track. But Im willing to quit entirely or just join paly or lahs track. Anything to get me a good season. Ive tried multiple times to get Granville to lessen the workouts. He's been over training our fast twitch muscles (muscles used for sprinting) which has caused great fatigue to set in. We had to run a 500x2 (1 1/4 lap) at 65 seconds per. This doesn't seem like anything but anyone who\u2019s reading this can\u2019t go sub 75. After we ran that, we were supposed to do these weird walking lunge drills and wickets (running over small hurdles to better your form). Then we had to do 3 point stands which no one could do and then we did normal block starts. Leaving just me to teach people how to properly start. Im notorious for having the worst start ever. But Granville being the \u201cGOAT\u201d left me to help people. He instead did some random sign in thing that we have to do. Which would bring me to the new rules. We have to sign in and out which uses up 30 minutes just to sign in and then another 30 to sign out. So an hour in total to make sure people come. We have to warm up on the field which is where throws happen to practice and Im not sure when but I know someone will be hit by a discus someday which could potentially kill them cause thats what happens when a 3lbs disc is flying at 20+mph slams into your head. We also have a rule where if you can come to 4/5 of the practices you basically just shouldn't come. My friend he has to miss a few days a week but is willing to make them up over the weekend taking No one else's but his time to run. But of course Granville says he should just quit. Mind you he\u2019s been running track since middle school. A little fun stupid rule we have is we can\u2019t run with our shirts off (guys) or in sports bras (girls). Which is so incredibly stupid cause when it hits 80 degrees + and we just ran our arses off and have a few more reps to go those shirts are going off. Its also just a runners pride thing to do build up a sweat enough to get those runners abs to glisten and then show off to the world. The last thing would be captains. Granville threatened the upper class men by saying \u201ccaptain positions, are available for anyone who appears to be a leader, this could mean a freshmen could be a captain.\u201d Some of y'all will probably be well just step up then. Heres the thing if we do then we suck up to Granville boosting his already peaked in high school \u201cGOAT\u201d ego but on the plus we get to be captain. Or we could do nothing have a freshmen who doesn\u2019t understand anything be a captain. The complete final rule was to not question his training styles/methods or anything in general. Even though we already have injured team mates, terrible workouts and horrible communication throughout the team. This may not seem strict but the track team is built on preppies (people who do it for the prep) and w/o them, we pretty much have no team. I\u2019m just kinda done with track now so I guess I quit.]",

He made me not like running. He took the joy out of it. The XC captains put their reputation and even college opportunities on the line to try to help and fix the team and when Granville would have none of it, they got admin involved. People were crying, too afraid to confront him but too injured to do his unreasonable and unfitting workouts. The captains planned an entire team trip and I was shocked and disappointed to learned he canceled it due to fake reasons he made up because his ego was hurt and he was upset at them for even questioning his authority. Track and XC gave me so much joy and allowed me to reduce my stress in high school. Due to Granville, I no longer had that outlet and had worse mental health due to this situation. To you outsiders, this may seem like a bunch of pointless drama, but it has been horrible. Admin has been involved and did nothing. The Oracle wrote an article...nothing. Parents got involved...nothing. Coaches got involved and they got fired. What can we do. Please help us.",

    "content": "8962. [This message was written by an active Gunn athlete, and is not endorsed by anyone else. It was written out of disgust, anger, and helplessness in an unfortunate situation. This post states only emotional opinions of many Gunn athletes, and is protected 1st amendment speech.] It is a legitimate shame to see Gunn's history of excellence in Track & Field and Cross Country coaching go down the drain like this. The administrators have chosen to ignore petty, clueless (only too an extent, one head coach is less guilty of this) power-hungry, tyrannic fools as head coaches because they seem to think it is \"easier\" and \"more cost effective\" than dealing with the fear, ineffectiveness, and outright tomfoolery brought about by this coaching dynasty. Gunn track coaches are incapable of working with anyone that isn\u2019t completely subservient in every way, a significant problem, considering any functioning track program in history has required assistant coaches. And so, it can perhaps be understandable that from a helpless student's perspective, Gunn administrators, and ESPECIALLY the Gunn sports administration, seem to care more about the face of the school and maintaining normalcy then the well-being of their students. It is positively disgraceful that a front-page article about coaching issues was published, with not only nothing to be done from it, but that the coaches only response was to talk about the athletes performance. We are HUMAN BEINGS, Not TROPHIES! I have seen athletes crying, unable to sleep and in severe emotional distress, not to speak of the effect it's had on the academic performance and livelihood of some because of incidents involving unacceptable excuses for \"coaching\". I have seen athletes exhausted and burnt out because some coaches have no idea how to train athletes. After-school sports are the life and blood of many , with some depending on the sports they play for college and beyond, yet this situation is thought to be acceptable. In addition, this year\u2019s track program has little to respect for student\u2019s outside schedules, with draconian attendance and practice polices being enforced left and right. Believe it or not, while students lives may revolve around sports, we still have activities outside of track and field. And so, to the Administration and anyone else complicit, I say this: SHAME ON YOU!",

The parking lot is fair game to everyone [8939. [2020] ok the juniors really out here taking up space in the parking lot and parking without a pass. when I was a junior I had to WALK the long and hard journey to Miranda where I parked everyday. THEY SHOULD HAVE TO DO THE SAME. I'm finally a senior and I did not pay over a hundred dollars to have to park in the very back of the lot because of stupid juniors who think they can get away with parking without a pass.

I asked her about it and she kinda started dodging the question and it seems to me that she's in denial or something. Anyways I've been in a relationship with her for a year and two months and I love her to bits and when she told me that she might be straight I cried for a couple hours and then started feeling really detached. She kept telling me \"no I'm actually not straight I only want to be with you\" but it's just strange to me that she'd bring up possibly being straight and then drop it like it's nothing. Ever since she said that, I've been having dreams/ thinking about my ex girlfriend who goes to this school. My current relationship wasn't a rebound, and my ex and I broke up on mutual terms and are still friendly with eachother. So I'm not sure why, but I'm just now realizing that I'm still incredibly attracted to my ex and I keep thinking about her and I feel super guilty about it. I keep smiling when I think about her and I really want to see her and talk to her and it's really stressing me out. I want to at least be friends with my ex but it's clear that I still have feelings. I still love my girlfriend and don't want to lose her or anything, so I feel really wrong about thinking so much about my ex. I guess I've just been thinking of other people because she said she might be straight, but I don't really know what to do. It's causing me a lot of emotional turmoil and I don't know how to bring it up to her.",

Are you telling me that Shakespeare legitimately thought of every single different interpretation of the themes in Hamlet? All hundred thousand of them? Or are you telling me that what Shakespeare's own interpretation of his own work doesn't mean anything? Math, Science, History, etc. all deal with actually objective *facts*. My English teacher literally explicitly said we can't be too objective with our analysis of literature; that we have to be creative. If everyone thinks that literature is an art, which it damn well might be, why is it considered to be academic? I doubt many people consider finger painting and singing to be academic. One could argue that essay writing is a useful skill, but then why not have a technical writing class instead of a literature class?",

On one hand, a higher g-loading makes the test less hackable, on the other hand, the exacerbated data discrepancies won't fare well with the media/masses. The SAT's finna be removed. We're tending toward a modern education (backed by modern \"psychologists\") where there won't be standardized tests, no judgement of one's ability, no classifying children as disabled or overabled - I don't know the intricacies of such a system because broadly it's so incoherent and delusional. The people with authority in these matters must be shivering in dissonance. Are you smart and principled and have a willingness to take according action? Well, you'll be stripped of everything you've ever cared for, they'll slash you and hammer you relentlessly and there are no second chances. That's if your principled in the backward manner. It isn't a drop off a cliff to hell. It's a gradual decline. This is the ideology we're working with. Nice PISA scores USA!",

[2020] So, according to my mom, admissions officers for private colleges are being extra selective this year in terms of admitting students from affluent backgrounds because of the college scandals. I understand financial background as a factor in giving scholarships, but the fact that a poor person with the same creds as an affluent person gets accepted and the affluent person gets flat out denied is kinda mean; in my opinion. First off, even if the poor person gets in, they might not actually go there because of a high price tag they simply can\u2019t afford and then the school will lose a potential candidate who could\u2019ve gone there and supported themselves while they attended the school.",

Every single one of you should be proud of yourselves. In a time where stress is so prevalent, can we take some time each day to be thankful for all the amazing things we have in life, and appreciate the people we have around us? All too often at Gunn I hear people talking about \"I'm gonna kms if I dont finish this\" or \"I'd rather die.\" Now while I know most of these are jokes, and some may not have a perspective of other stressors, but it's just saddening to hear. Over the past month, I have been to the doctors several times due to heart issues. I have had multiple shots, blood tests, and beyond imaginable things. It's so different when you see life from a perspective like that. Before, I'd cry over finals. I'd stress and stress until my lungs felt collapsed ... (which also could've contributed to my current heart problems). When these issues occurred for me this year, I literally cannot express to you how little I stress over finals. Actually, I do not give a single shit if I get a B- instead of a B. Because I'm glad I get to be with my family, and live my life, rather than being stuck in a shitty doctors office. I'm telling you now... you will do great. You will do good things in your life. A single grade is not worth your health. Over time, you will realize what means the most to you. This is just a small step in your life, you will face harder challenges, and it will be ok. You will get through it with the help of others and knowing what is truly important in your life. With that being said, goodluck on finals. Enjoy your break, you deserve it. <3",

What pisses me off is that there are some people like me who work their asses off without cheating and don't do so well on tests as the cheaters. It's really frustrating to see those who cheat get into top schools, when they really don't deserve it. I guess this is a question for all the people who literally find every way to cheat on tests (you know exactly who you are) .

No one deserves to be reduced to their legacy status or blamed for taking advantage of the privilege they were born with or even blamed for having the privilege they were born with. We are all benefiting from the privilege we were born into, whether it means attending one of the best public schools in CA, living in Silicon Valley, etc. I have to say, though, that \"getting into Stanford and being from this area\" does not, in fact, \"[show] that you\u2019re even more qualified.\" It's still important to acknowledge that legacies have a significant advantage over non-legacy applicants. And I don't think anyone believes legacies with \"3.0\u2019s and zero [extracurriculars]\" are accepted into Stanford. StRaW mAn ArGuMeNt spotted. I'm on to you, dude. All Stanford applicants, whether accepted, rejected, or deferred, I hope you know that you were probably qualified and legacy is just a way colleges choose between applicants--it's a factor out of your control. For the FEW people who are still pissed, I hope you're pissed at the college system and not at your peers. [8596. [2020] Ok this is my first confession just bc it annoyed me so much to the point where I had to say something. For all of you guys who are salty about the legacy kids getting into Stanford. I am also a legacy kid as my parent literally works there. I didn\u2019t even apply. But for everyone who is throwing shots and getting salty just because ur other peers got in: grow up. It honestly shows the type of person you are. It\u2019s different if their parents are donating thousands of dollars and buy their kids\u2019 way in-now THATS unfair. Stanford is such a prestigious school and their standards are very high. On top of that, Stanford is a really diverse school. Do you really think they\u2019d accept someone FROM THE STANFORD AREA who WAS NOT QUALIFIED? No, hun. If anything, getting into Stanford and being from this area shows that you\u2019re even more qualified. You still have to be up to par to even be considered to such an elite school like Stanford. They aren\u2019t out here accepting kids with 3.0\u2019s and zero extra curriculars just because \u201cthere mom/dad works there\u201d. Like it\u2019s honestly so frustrating. Are u really going to bring ur other classmates down just bc they got in and u didn\u2019t? Like grow up, man. This entire process is really frustrating and stressful for everyone. Look at it as a sign that maybe going to Stanford wasn\u2019t in your fate after all and that everything happens for a reason. If they didn\u2019t accept you then they don\u2019t deserve you!!!

[2020] @8596 You know when this perennial controversy came into relevance again, I initially felt a bit sympathetic for those that are targeted for getting into Stanford with legacy/faculty connections. But I am getting more and more repulsed by all these confessions posted trying to erase a blatant factor of privilege. I felt quite indifferent about this whole situation in the very first place as I didn't apply to Stanford (I feel like the school is overvalued so much that it has cast a toxic air over the entire Silicon Valley), but I am both shocked and amused by how far people will go to pretend as if those with connections don't have any sort of advantage. Yes, there are \"salty\" people and calling people accepted w/ connections \"cheaters\" is wrong\u2014because \"cheating\" implies that some rule is broken. Having a faculty/legacy connections that can significantly favor you is not against the rules. Now are the rules good? That is the debate to have. But posts\u2014including this as well as @8514, @8537, @8586\u2014show that you don't get the point. Any serious person knows that legacy does not entail automatic admission. We have heard of students denied from Stanford in spite of their connections. To say that such connections have no bearing on the admission process\u2014why, that's a lie and you all know it yourselves. It is absolutely ludicrous to somehow twist facts so much when you assert that this is 100% fair. You draw a line here by characterizing \"donating thousands of dollars and buy their kids\u2019 way in\" as unfair. But why do you draw an arbitrary line there? Why should someone's familial connection to a faculty member be considered as a fair factor in admission? You do realize that nobody is claiming somebody with a 3.0 GPA and zero extra curriculars can get into Stanford, right? The people seriously considered for Stanford are all very qualified\u2014and those who have connections possess a significant advantage over this already extremely qualified pool of applicants, regardless of whether or not they are really the best for Stanford out of that pool. That is the heart of the debate we are having here. You go this far trying to cover for those with connections by asserting how they \"deserve\" to get in\u2014but do those passionate and hard-working kids who just fell short from admission thanks to the legacy factor not deserve to get in Stanford? This isn't about \"bringing other people down\". This is complaining about a process that brings people down. If anything, any of you going on Gunn Confessions to whine about how other people are unhappy about you getting into Stanford w/ connections is a sign of immaturity. You got in for a big part because the Stanford Admissions deem you are qualified and appropriate, but also undeniably due to your connections. Don't try to erase the fact you are privileged. Acknowledge that you are fortunate that you have those connections and others are less fortunate, and stop whining. Nothing kills me more than somebody crying over getting into Stanford because they have legacy connections. How about all of those who shed tears because they did not get into Stanford\u2014those who may love the school just as much as you? It bewilders me how much the Gunn community is willing to defend privilege, while not giving a crap about those who are less fortunate. Again, I do hear this other conversation about how most people at Gunn are privileged with great education to begin with. That is a good conversation to have. However, in the context of criticizing the Stanford legacy factor, that just detracts from the topic at hand\u2014because the legacy factor is much more egregious than any of other forms of legal advantages/privileges entailed. If we want equity, there is an order of operations. Just first eliminate this arbitrary and nepotistic legacy factor from admissions. Most European universities have done so already.",

It's an artificial force of a distinct class, let the people be, let cultures be. The harm whence justification derives is contrived, intervene when culture threatens your humanity. For context, is it nothing but coincidence that (predominantly) temperate-climate asians outperform affluent whites? (and ashkenazis outperform temperate-climate asians), nevermind the persecution and indisputably ravaged backgrounds from which many arise? No. This is a neglect of heritability of temperament, of propensity, of capacity. Is it not a mark of disrespect, to submit to the representation of clamoring folk, who themselves experience nothing of your culture? Culture? What's culture? After migration to a community with no (delineated) holistic values? An emergent result of alike propensities. You're clashing against nature - in the wrong way.",

If people can sit back and label goddamn golf, which is the boringest fucking sport in the world, a goddamn sport, if you can label that shit as a sport, and if you can label goddamn fishing as a sport, I know damn well you can label jacking off a sport. Think about it, what the fuck athletically are you really doing in golf, my nigga? All you doing is hitting a goddamn golf club, \u201cOh my God man, that\u2019s a long ass birdie man, nice birdie, nice putt, man it went 250 yards.\u201d Get the fuck outta here, nobody care about that boring ass shit. Who the fuck really watches golf, my nigga? Nobody gives a fuck, it makes niggas fall asleep. Fishing on the other hand, what the fuck are you really doing athletically, my nigga, in fishing? All you\u2019re doing is that you\u2019re sitting your bitch ass up in a boat, usually it\u2019s old ass snagger-teeth motherfuckers that ain\u2019t got no goddamn teeth up in they fucking grill, or up in they mouth. They\u2019re just sitting up the goddamn boat, you know what I\u2019m saying. Throwing a goddamn rod. It can be any kind of goddamn bait up on the end of the rod. It can be a worm, it can be a caterpillar, it can be a centipede, it can be a dead ass butterfly, it can be a fucking beak of a damn bird, it can be a fucking, it can be anything, you know what I\u2019m saying? \u201cOh my God! We caught a big ass salmon, reel that fat bitch in, yeah.\u201d Motherfucker, what are you doing athletically? How the fuck is that working up a sweat, my nigga? What, you\u2019re working out your arms, because you have to reel that motherfucker in? Nigga, that\u2019s not a sport, dawg. Well, fuck it. You know what, it is a sport. Fuck it. You guys want to consider that shit to be a sport? Jacking off is a fucking sport to me. Jacking off and beating your motherfucking dick to porn is a sport. There\u2019s two damn things that you have to do. A. You build up a sweat. Well actually, you don\u2019t have to do shit. There\u2019s basically two things that goes down, that\u2019s what I meant to say. A. You\u2019re building up a sweat. I don\u2019t give a fuck nigga, if you are building up a sweat, goddamn it, that\u2019s shit is considered a sport. You\u2019re building up a sweat. Number 2, and the most important part of that shit, is that your hand is getting a workout. Your hand is getting a workout, nigga, you are building up your arm strength, and you are building up your hand strength, okay. I don\u2019t know about you, nigga, but when I\u2019m beating my shit, nigga, my fucking hand muscles get fucking tight, you know what I\u2019m saying? And that shit wears the fuck out of my entire left arm. I used to be able to do it with my right hand, can\u2019t do that shit, so I do it with my left hand. So, in my personal opinion, do you guys consider jacking off a sport? Nigga, in my opinion, I believe it is. So I know with some of you trolling ass faggot bitches are gonna say \u201cOh, man, you must not get no pussy, motherfucker, if you jack off.\u201d Motherfucker, let\u2019s be real, okay? Everybody has jacked off once in they goddamn life. If you gonna sit back, and you gonna come on my video, and troll my shit, say \u201cOh, nigga, I never jacked off once in my life.\u201d Bitch, stop lying. Everybody does this shit, okay? So please miss me with that bullshit, nigga, and go preach that shit to somebody who fucking is actually gonna listen to you, okay? Number 2, \u201cOh my God, this video was stupid. It was pointless.\u201d Couldn\u2019t\u2019ve been that stupid, bitch, you still clicked on it! You know what I\u2019m saying? All the motherfuckers that\u2019s watching this video, nigga, you saw the title of the fucking video before you clicked on the video. So it couldn\u2019t\u2019ve been that damn stupid if you still proceeded to click on the motherfucker. So, jacking off. The shit\u2019s a sport, fuck it.",

Hey don't judge No I will judge this war crime I saw committed before my very eyes. such an act of combining two foods, one with such potential and the other a vile and disgusting sad excuse for a condiment is where I draw the line in where I say that I can judge people. If I had my way they would be tried before the world court for crimes against humanity. The very thought of what that abomination might taste like makes me want to die. The fact that those two things were the ONLY thing that person had on their plate makes me sick at the thought and makes me wonder what kind of disease this sad human has to make them commit such a heinous and dangerous crime and I hope that I will never witness such an horrible thing in my life. Thanks for coming to my TED talk now I will go gouge my eyes out.",

The reason the US government got involved in the war was because of the 9/11 attacks. Therefore if it wasn\u2019t for those brave soldiers in that plane, Thanos would have destroyed half the universe.",

My pp was stuck in the dvd, and I had to break it in half to get if out. It was then when I flipped the broken dvd over and realized that it was not a blank dvd, but a copy of the movie UP.\nWell guys, guess I fucked up.",

However, what about the reverse of this Rule? If there is no porn of it, it does not exist. This is the unspoken dark side of The Rule. I quickly asked myself \"is there porn of me?\". I nervously typed in my name on some popular porn sites. I didn't find anything. As I went from one porn site to the next, dread slowly filled me. Pornhub. The Rule remains true. Xvideos. The Rule remains true. Youporn. The Rule remains true. I got desperate, so I went to more obscure and niche websites. Hentai Haven. The Rule Remains true. Nhentai. The Rule Remains true. Hanime. The Rule remains true. I even visited the dark web looking for anything. Even a crayon drawing would do. But as I clicked on the last porn website and typed in my name, I realized that I was slowly fading out of existence. Quickly I opened Adobe Photoshop and started drawing porn of myself. It was the only way. Head, body, arms. I was 25% gone. Legs, feet, knees. I was 50% gone. Now all I needed was the dick. This was the challenging part. I drew and I drew. I was 75% gone. My dick took up most of the canvas. I was 90% gone. I was almost done. I just needed the tip. I was 99% Gone. When I finished I was relieved. Somehow I had broken the rule. And when I noticed, reality began to collapse. Everyone should make porn of themselves to be safe. So yeah, that's why you should send me nudes.",

Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.\n\"MINECRAFT...\"\nBut they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.\n\"Minecraft good Fortnite bad\"\nAnd then the silence broke\n\"OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::\"\nThousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.\nI started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.\n\"M-m-mi... Mine...\"\nAlready some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.\n\"MINE...\"\nNearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.\n\"MINEC-C-C-CRAFT *voice crack*\"\nA billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.\n\"MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT\"\nNo matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.\nNearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.\n10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...\nI look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.\n0.\n\"Minecraft good Fortnite bad Instagram normie Emojis bad Keanu breathtaking Wholesome 100 [Everyone liked that] Area 51 PETA bad 69 nice 420\"\n\"AaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyaYayaYaASyAAaYaaYayaAAAaaUGgGHHhHHhhHHhhHHh\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc40\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75mmmmMMMMmMmMMMMMMMMM\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\udca6hhhhhhHhFFFfffF\"\nBillions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.\nThe Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.\nHumanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.\nThis is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.\nCongratulations.",

I don't feel offended by it or anything, as I know the person 9 times out of 10 doesn't mean anything by it. However, there is this weird subconscious thing that builds up that tells you how different you are. It tells you that if you come out, people will treat you differently. And I try to ignore it, but I can't. And, I hate to admit it, but it's one of the main reasons I haven't really come out.\nNow, I'm not expecting everyone to suddenly stop, nor am I asking to I guess. I should probably just learn to ignore that stupid voice in my head. I'm just pointing out that words can have impacts that are unintended, and intended to be harmless jokes like this can affect people.\nWho knows though. Maybe when I get to college it'll change and I can come out there.",

I thought I wouldn't have a chance with this girl, she was amazing but I thought I had no dice, I'm just a friend to her. Done deal right? I moved on. And then I got a crush on this other girl, and I think she is sort of interested in me, not to the point of romantic feelings but the possibility there and I like her a lot. A LOT. like 3x more than I liked OG crush. In fact she really made me turn around my life. I used to be pretty depressed but now I am happy just thinking of her, I have better social network now spurred from connecting with her, I started working out and now I feel a lot better about my body. Okay, here is where things get crazy. Now I am picking up signals from OG crush that she likes me, and mutual friends suspect she has a crush me and I am starting to like her again. BUT I still like crush #2 more and I don't know how to feel. What should I do?????!?!?!? I don't know how to feel- pursue romantic feelings with girl 1 or girl 2? AAAAAAAAAA this is tormenting me",

Looking back, the weight of those problems dragged me down for 4+ years. Your mental health impacts every aspect of your life, and it should absolutely be one of your first priorities. I also thought I could just do certain things and overcome my issues myself. Well, believe me that even if you exercise, and eat right, and have lots of social activity, and even meditate you cannot fix an imbalance of chemicals in your brain. If you are in the spot I was: you don't have to put up with the weight, and you deserve a normal life. Ask for help.",

Most people get that.\nI guess the main part that bugs people is that you guys (or at least the people I\u2019ve seen) don\u2019t acknowledge that being a legacy or having a faculty family member IS a privilege. You do get a leg up. At least recognize that privilege. Your privilege doesn\u2019t degrade your academics, but it\u2019s there, and it\u2019s a big part of your application.\nIts another layer of your application that they DO weigh heavily. Not to blame them: the more people in a family that go to the same school, the more likely the school will get donations, which will help with funding new programs. It\u2019s sucks for us not legacy/ connection people, but capitalism.\nI guess my point is this: legacies are a thing. They will always be a thing. People can\u2019t blame those with legacy/ faculty connections for having the privilege that they do. But if you\u2019re lucky enough to have this privilege, appreciate you\u2019re parents and know that in the end, it does boost you. A lot.\n[8514.

All those of you stressing and gossiping about college, remember this: top SV companies are full of grads from all over the place. NO ONE CARES where you go to school. What matters is what YOU as a person bring to the table. Plenty of top execs from no name colleges out there. Also plenty of Ivy, MIT, Caltech, Stanford grads who get fired from their jobs for being entitled and for performing poorly. Put this on REPEAT in you head regardless of what your friends and family say: THE COLLEGE NAME DOES NOT MATTER. YOU MATTER. Live happily. That's all.",

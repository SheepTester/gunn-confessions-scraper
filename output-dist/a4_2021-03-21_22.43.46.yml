    content: "lol, equating being an actively participating student to being an ass kisser. don't ask for a rec letter please, those letters will be much better spent on people who actually appreciate the teacher and the things they learn in class. the fact that you even made this submission shows how little you appreciate the effort teachers put into teaching the class and trying to be engaged with their students."

    content: "what do you define as \"kissing teachers' asses?\" Is it talking to the teacher and being nice to them? Because that's just building connections, something which is very good to do, particularly in college when professors may help you jobs. There's a difference between \"ass kissing\" and being nice. I think just being nice to teachers is enough to build a connection so they can write a rec letter"

Most people have probably already seen Thor: Ragnarok since it's an MCU movie, but he's made lots of great ones. Off the top of my head, I particularly enjoyed What We Do in the Shadows (which, if you really enjoy that, there's also an American TV show based on it), Hunt for the Wilderpeople, and Jojo Rabbit! I think most of his films should be available through the local library... though apparently Hunt for the Wilderpeople is actually available for free with ads on YouTube. https://youtu.be/OKqUnhp3rQI"

I think 1600.io is quite solid and very affordable. The SAT Black Book could be useful too.\n\nI will mention that collegeboard has an unique way of making the tests, and I don't think companies like PrincetonReview or Barron does a good job at trying to replicate them, so definitely first turn to official practice tests rather than trash replicas"

Some guy wants to know how long it is in km. A mile is 1.6 km\". You're allowed to use a TI-nspire CAS on it. You'll do fine. \n\nRemember to take time to enjoy high school, don't let studying take over your life completely."

- content: "11391. [2021] I've been giving an idea of mine some thinking over, and I thought it might be good to get some second opinions on this: \nI have a lot of crushes on a lot of people. Obviously this year has been quite an unexpected senior year for me, and it's quite sad to know that I'll probably never get to see most of my classmates ever again. Because of that, I've had this idea to non-anonymously message all of the people who I've admired to tell them how I feel. I'm not expecting anything back from it, but I just think it could be a nice bit of positivity to end off our weird senior year with. However, I'm afraid it might come off as a bit creepy, especially since I don't really know all of these people so well, though I personally feel like I would enjoy getting a message like that. So, I have two questions to any kind souls who would like to respond to this confession:\n1. Is this indeed a really creepy thing to do, so I should not do it? \n2. If the answer to the previous question is \"no, I think that would actually be really sweet\", would anybody like to join me? (If there are people who would, I might come out publicly with who I am and try to arrange this more formally, probably sometime in the last month of the school year.)\n\n#GunnConfessions11391"

    content: "Infographics are more eye-catching and easier to read for most people, and they don't have to leave the app. It's also easier for them to share across social media—videos and Instagram posts doesn't make it very easy to share links—and since everything is contained in a single image, it can survive being screenshotted and thrown around as opposed to text, which can get collapsed under a \"view more,\" for example. Sometimes people do link to the articles but I feel like many people ignore them."

It's like I assumed I didn't have the moderation so I would just be like \"yeah I'm a drug addict, you got me\", but at this point I really don't think I'm addicted to weed. Yeah I smoke 4/7 days of the week but even when I run out I don't mind that much, I just spend my time playing guitar or doing things other than smoking. And honestly, my family is cool with it now and I get my medical card soon.\n\npeople judge me all the time for smoking weed and go like \"imagine using drugs\" (like it's something so bad. like you wouldn't call alcohol a \"drug\" but yet you call weed a drug, even though it's less harmful).\n\nimo, y'all need to stop judging people for using medical marijuana and realize we about to be adults soon (which about half of us already are)\n\nalso yes ik this is very fucking ez to figure out who i am, but i really don't care lol\n\n#GunnConfessions11379"

- content: "11364. One of the most important things I’ve learned in life didn’t come from school. If someone isn’t willing to love you the way you love them, you need to let them go. I’ve had people tell me this for years and I never listened. I had to truly experience the slow pain of wanting to talk to someone yet having the self control to not message them. I think this kind of acceptance is necessary. The alternative is chasing after someone you will never be with. That pain is far worse.\n\nIf there’s a friend who you really love. Tell them how you feel. If they don’t feel the same way, and every time you talk to them you have an aching feeling in your heart, you should stop talking to them and move on with your life. It’ll be healthier for both of you. Constantly seeing or talking to them will only serve as a reminder of what could have been if only you had been better. But the truth is, it was never about you. It was about them. They didn’t want to be with you, and you can’t do anything about it. Just let go.\n\nOf course some can stay friends after telling someone how you feel. If you can, you should. But to those that can’t handle it emotionally, I recommend you to let go and not talk to them anymore. There’s nothing noble or romantic about chasing someone who doesn’t want you.\n\n#GunnConfessions11364"

At the same time, when someone is strong enough to share their trauma with you or within your community your first action should not be to tell them to forgive, but rather give the person all your love and support. Because you will never understand what they went through, and the decision/journey to forgive is entirely their own. The best thing you can do is to show that you are there for them as they heal, and when/if they get to that point, they can decide for themselves. \n\n#GunnConfessions11359"

There’s no real homework for the class, more like finishing up worksheets and working on labs/CERs, and A LOT of the content is just harder practice or adding onto what you learned last year. Ms. Zizmor is awesome and wants you to do well— don’t listen to the upperclassmen who tell you youre guaranteed a C or lower if you take the class. Study well for tests and you’ll do fine.

- content: "11344. [2021] Ok, someone mentioned it before, but I just have to say it. In the series of confessions posted on Jan 17, I counted over 15 negative comments from the same person. Comments along the lines of \"who asked?\" on posts where people are confessing troubles, worries, or things giving them stress.\n\nThis is Gunn CONFESSIONS. This is the page that asks. The whole point of this page is people can come here to share things no one asked. Seeing comments like yours is exactly why we need pages like this. Because of insensitive little pricks thinking they are funny.\n\nThey'll probably comment on this saying \"lol go cry harder\" and think they're being funny. I might imagine they even comment that directly, copypaste, just to \"be funny\".\n\nThe beautiful thing about this page a few years ago was that, while it was NEVER wholesome or innocent (soap dispensers :P), it was a place where, if someone was being serious, they could get support. If I had something on my mind, something so inconsequential I could never share it in person but I needed to get off my chest, I could come here, and people would support each other.\n\nMaybe you think you're being funny, but it is attitudes like yours, people who think they are just being funny, that cause people with actual anxiety and stress who are coming here to receive some consolation and relieve some stress, to have their stress levels go up. \n\nSo you probably won't heed this. You'll shrug it off, comment something stupid on this post then keep scrolling commenting \"who asked?\" cause it gives you attention. But I want to say, to anyone who has read this far, and to anyone who has or wants to post a worry, a concern, or stresser they have, I'm sorry. Sorry this school and now this page have to deal with this.\n\nAnd as for \"go cry harder\", yes. I will. Cause I KNOW that crying is not a sign of weakness. That in order to overcome a pain, it needs to be acknowledged.\n\n#GunnConfessions11344"

They don't have to be big goals just give yourself something to work towards too. From personal experience accomplishing small goals can improve your day by a lot. Also don't take failures as a way to insult yourself use them as a lesson so you can improve yourself. There's no point in putting yourself down so might as well use it to your advantage. Failures can be a blessing in disguise."

- content: "11337. [2020] If you think having faculty or distinguished legacy parents means \"nothing\" on Stanford applications, you're delusional. I'm not going to discredit faculty kids who got into Stanford, but let's be real, take a step back and look at who gets in every year. Hint - they're nearly all faculty. You know there are plenty of people at Gunn who are Stanford material and whether or not faculty kids are is irrelevant. I'm sure there are dozens of kids including faculty who worked their ass off, but in nearly every case faculty will be picked first.\n\nIf you're from Palo Alto and go to faculty schools (Menlo/Castilleja/Paly/Gunn) as a non-faculty you're better off applying to the rest of Ivy+ with your ED/EA/REA slot. If you're faculty I encourage you to make every use of your parent's connections and have no shame in doing so. You don't pick where your parents work and no one will blame you for taking the best route for your education. But don't say that your acceptance had nothing to do with your parents. \n\n#GunnConfessions11337"

- content: "11332. [2024] Hello, I am a freshman new here at Gunn. Tomorrow we are going back to class and for some reason, I am just dreading it so much. I'm dreading the quizzes and projects and the anxiety of checking my grades. I'm dreading the constant reloading of Schoology to see if any of my teachers updated my grades. I know most of you are reading this like \"bruh ur just a freshman it's gunna get so much worse. Be grateful for how easy you have it\". And I get it. I know I sound so immature compared to some of the troubles y'all are having with college apps and AP and SAT etc. I cannot begin to fathom the amount of anxiety going through the SAT and college apps during covid. But the transition between middle school and high school is like being thrown into a dark icy sea without learning how to swim. During middle school, sure I was anxious about my grades but mind you, at the time a 93% was my world collapsing around me. An 80% used to destroy me. Now I am completely numb to the 63% or the 73% that I have gotten last semester. I remember going to sleep and thinking to myself, \"I just want one day where there are no deadlines. No stress. Nothing due, and nothing to study for. I want to wake up naturally and just spend the day watching Youtube or playing games without guilt.\" Over this winter break, I got many of those days. and it was so refreshing. For once I didn't refresh my Schoology page every hour shaking and staring at the notification button. But now those days are over. Tomorrow, it is back to the grades and tests. Again, I hope I don't sound ungrateful or selfish since most of the people reading this have it worse than me. And I would like to say that I also have it better than most people in my grade. Not all of my subjects are trouble points and I still have one subject in which I am doing really well. For that, I am grateful, truly. But I am so scared to go back to the stress and fear that plagues most of the classes. Thanks for reading if you're still here lmao:)\n\n#GunnConfessions11332"

And just because you aren’t necessarily doing all that rn doesn’t mean your stress isnt just as valid... also the transition from middle to hs is hard for a lot of people and online is rough—I can’t imagine how difficult it would be to be doing everything online at a completely new school.

    content: "I found that one mindset really helps me with my stress: excellence doesn't require perfection.\n\nThis really frees my mind to focus on doing my best, instead of getting stuck in anxiety over a difficult problem that causes me to mess up easier questions. \n\nCertainly grades are important. And even though it isn't an end all be all, I do think you're justified to care a lot about grades. However, in my belief, stressing over it is a choice. It might be difficult, but you can choose to say to yourself \"I'm not stressed for this test, I'm excited for it!\" You can let one bad grade ruin your mental health, or you can try to let it go and focus on not making the same mistakes.\n\nIt certainly isn't easy, but I want to remind you that you are in power. You decide how you respond to challenges. You figure out what works best for you. You can be scared, or you can believe that you're tough and capable of facing difficulties.\n\nWe believe in you."

I put more effort into classes I would otherwise not care about at all because I'm being evaluated, but it also makes me care less about the classes I'm actually interested in because all I have to show for the learning is how much I gamed the grading system in the end (in high school at least. In college, when there's some control over what classes I take, it got a lot better.)"

I have been suggesting for decades that our motivation to learn should be learning itself. In which case, good grades usually follow.

Maybe not the most optimistic point of view, but class of 2021 doesn't have much more time to grow as friends."

I can't talk for anyone but myself and I think your feelings ring true for others like me. It's extremely difficult for anyone to make new friends without in-person experiences, and I know I've also just drifted away from the friends I had in-person. I think many people feel what you feel, but for us seniors, this is not the last year. Next year exists, it just won't be *at* Gunn. Even if you don't post on social media, either now or even after graduation, it's a perfect way to reach out to fellow Gunn kiddos (if you feel like it, second semester might be a good time to try to get to know the people you didn't get to, even if it's just chatting online for a day or two). You're right, vaccines are definitely not going to be fast enough to give us a regular second semester, but they're going to have some kind of effect on us eventually, too. In the meantime, have an online hug from an anonymous friend. \n\n#GunnConfessions11253"

- content: "11243. [2021] I thought that I would start exploring dating in my senior year, but now most of my socialization is just on discord. I shouldn't even be thinking romantically when I'm not even close with my close friends anymore.\n\nNow I feel alone more than ever. I know I'm never going to see most of the people I knew in-person until probably May, and even then there won't be enough time to catch up. That's not even considering the *more than one year* of connections fading and 'life moving on' to those people who probably have gone months without thinking of me.\n\nBut all this leads me to a concerning thought: I'm not forming new friendships or even acquaintances. It's so easy to drift apart from a friend during the pandemic. And, sure, you might meet up with a good friend in-person every week or two (maintaining an existing friendship). \n\nBut what about BECOMING friends with someone? ...and getting close to the point that you'd meet them in-person? It seems impossible. I feel trapped. \n\nThe worst part there's no \"next year\" for seniors. We're not coming back to campus. We can't \"ride it out\". I'm fucking done. I'm not going to have a social comeback at Gunn. All that's left is social media, an if I don't post (which I don't), I've dropped off the face of the earth.\n\n#GunnConfessions11243"

It's always annoying to hear people, who hold the more popular belief in their area, talk about not being afraid to express their opinions. Easy enough for them to say it when they don't fear unjustifiable backlash. It seems more important that we first address this toxic climate where people act like 6 year olds when somebody else has a differing opinion"

    content: "I mean... part of it is that these are real people and real quotes... to change the f-slur would be to change what people have actually said. None of the script is fiction- its all from interviews. The hijab.... is a bit iffier, but I feel to not have the hijab would be an inaccurate portrayal of the character, particularly since she brings it up. Plus, these are actors. There's a tricky line in society about how much is appropriation and how much is \"they are actors\". I feel like acknowledging that these are real people, real things they said, and to change it would be to disrespect them and what the show stands for. \n\nThis is an important show, and I believe Gunn Theatre has put it on to the best of its ability this year. Feel free to DM me if you want to talk more, as I think this is a very interesting topic"

Even if you don’t believe in higher minimum wage, it’s still not right.\n\nThe governments job is so what’s best for its citizens, not to take in people whose governments failed them.

    content: "White-hot indeed, at least around here! Most research has shown that illegal immigration tends to boost the economy (for example, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41645 if you're curious), and also tends to decrease crime (see https://www.factcheck.org/2018/06/is-illegal-immigration-linked-to-more-or-less-crime/). This isn't talking about \"educated immigrants\", but all unauthorized immigrants. I agree that taking advantage of illegal immigrants' cheap labor while advocating for higher minimum wage is contradictory. After naturalization, of course, illegal immigrants would be subject to the minimum wage. I'm wondering what has \"changed since that inscription was made\", though, to invalidate having an open policy towards immigrants who—while perhaps not educated—are generally less violent than native-born citizens."

Until all the votes have been counted, recounts are done, all the votes certified, electors have met in each state, the Senate has received the electors' ballots, and Congress has counted the electoral votes he has technically not won. Not a Trump supported just a person frustrated with the media getting it all wrong. It is a very good prediction not certain yet."

- content: "11199. [2021] Lowkey really scared and pissed off at the reopening plans. Nearly every high school around the country that has reopened has had to close down within the month. \n\nAlso.... it's the height of the flu season? We are in the middle of a world wide pandemic that as I write this is only getting worse. People will travel for the holidays. WHY are we talking about reopening in January? Don't gimme that \"but we're Palo Alto we can be safe\" BS. I've seen the Instagrams of people hugging their friends with no masks.\n\nWe are really gonna force the teachers back into classrooms with these people? Don Austin has said that he is designing the reopening around how many students say they will return, and refused to say whether they would be forcing teachers who don't want to return back or not (basically, they will).\n\nOn the topic... Don Austin's talk about how \"I only plan 1/3 of my speeches before I make them, and they go well, so let's just go ahead with reopening\"? That does NOT give me confidence. We only are hearing a semi-concrete plan NOW, when he stated that we WILL be going back in summer. I'm sorry. Also... saying that teachers and admin agree on nearly all negotiable items and that the community shouldn't be so upset... is misleading. Don Austin has said that the reopening is NON-negotiable. That's where the biggest disagreement between teachers and admin is. \"Negotiable\" items means stuff how many pencils to have in class.\n\nAbout 90% of secondary teachers don't want to return. Why aren't they being listened to? At a recent schoolboard meeting, the only reason there were representatives from the teacher's union and classified staff union speaking was because the parents DEMANDED they speak. This is not how you treat your staff.\n\nIf you are a student who is really struggling with distance learning, I'm sorry. This is not meant to shame you. I believe we can possibly expand the current PAUSD+ program. However, If students aren't able to work from home well, explain to me this. How will going from being on Zoom at home 5 days a week to being at school 2 days a week for only 2 classes with all other classes STILL at home be much better?\n\nI'm honestly kinda disgusted at how fast the reopening has been pushed, and how widespread the schoolboard is trying to make it. Nearly every other school district in the Bay Area has announced that they are staying full distance.\n\n#GunnConfessions11199"

One the other hand it’s good for him to know by saying that he’s not being a “nice guy” and doesn’t deserve girls respecting him for that... but it also looks bad on the girls by just shutting him down... but also it’s not girls responsibility to look proper al the time so maybe this is misogynistic that I immediately thought they were being a little annoying... in conclusion: idk \n\n#GunnConfessions11162"

[2021] Most of the parents here claim to be politically liberal and constantly virtue signal, but in reality they'd have a heart attack at the thought of PAUSD's demographics suddenly changing to one with a higher % of BIPOC, especially if economically those students came from less wealthy families. The hypocrisy here is unreal with $ getting spent on \"college advisors\", \"test prep\", and my favorite \"tutors\" who basically just feed you last year's exams and answers. Basically, you have to have $ parents who enable you to either flat out cheat (tutors w/ old tests) or use wealth to stretch the boundaries of an SAT score beyond what a student would be capable of without the additional assistance. All of these closet racists (asian families, you know exactly what I'm talking about...) and over-privileged will be proudly wearing an \"I Voted\" sticker (while wearing a mask of course!) and pulling the lever for Biden will living a life more reflective of Trump.\n\n#GunnConfessions11137"

Without any makeup or even trying to look nice she’s prettier than me!\n\nI’m honestly super surprised that not that many people know her. A lot of people think she’s shy and quiet, but she’s actually super talkative once you get to know her. We love you, Sophia! Keep being you!\n\n#GunnConfessions11118"

- content: "11111. [2022] Ok right now it's all online so it's not as bad, but I really hate how Gunn likes to make us participate in SELF and act like they know a ton about mental health and act like what they've done has helped so so many people. Like, let's be honest. SELF has helped maybe a handful of students, and props to them for that, but think about how many more students are stressed and sick of listening to their insensitive presentations about being happy and stuff. If someone needs help, they're better off with a professional than your nonsense.\nThere have been multiple times in SELF where I literally wanted to break down crying because of the stuff they were talking about and how sugarcoated it was and then got yelled at my teacher for being on my computer because my head literally could not handle the bs they were teaching.\nDon't force SELF onto us please.\nWe aren't 5. And teachers aren't professionals. \nDon't try and help when you don't know what you're doing. \n\nTherefore: Please remove SELF. It's not a safe place for anyone. I barely know the names of anyone in my class and it's been 3 years. It constantly brings up triggering topics (ie. r*pe, mental health, etc) without any warning or consideration for the students. None of the teachers are well versed in the subject and cannot help anyone because they literally do not have the credentials to do it. Stop wasting our time. \nPlease let it be a free period instead so that I can play among us with friends so I can actually be happier, ya know?\nAnyways... red is always sus :)\n\n#GunnConfessions11111"

[2023] the next time you blame a teacher for making your life hard right now, know that though your complaints may be valid, sometimes it's necessary to put them into perspective.\n\nliving in one of the most expensive areas of the country, many of our teachers make much less than the amount of money necessary for a comfortable life. many have to support families or put themselves through school on the side. others have been working for a long time and have genuine trouble transitioning to an online setting while being worried about their health and safety right now.\n\nmany of our teachers spent weeks training and learning during the summer, putting themselves through courses and sessions on how to best support us in this online setting—all without being paid.\n\nas a student, i can relate to the feeling of wanting to complain or pass on blame right now. stress is a real thing. managing life and school is hard, especially currently. having issues with teachers is a valid and real feeling. but perspective really helps understand that sometimes, issues should be allowed to exist without being slapped onto someones shoulders in the form of blame.\n\ntry and give them the benefit of the doubt right now :))\n\n#GunnConfessions11102"

    content: "TIPS\nStress management: Making time to do stuff that will chill you out, like organizing your workspace, doing a sport/hobby/art thing you like or buying your favorite food. Try to make the time at the end of the day once you already have your activities for the day done.\n\nDealing with APs (or any class in general): Read the syllabus. Make a google drive/computer file for each class with the syllabus downloaded/in the folder. Reference it whenever you're confused. Email your teachers when confused.\n\nMaking time for extracurriculars: Treat them as a break from schoolwork - try to get into the mindset to commit time to them without worrying about assignments. Drop the ones that aren't helping you in any way (socially/making you happy/looking good on apps, etc.)"

    content: "Hi! I’ll be helping everyone who wants to join the Speech and debate team. It might seem intimidating at first, but we start off by teaching just all of our new members in order to transition you to choosing a branch. I felt a similar way when first joining the club, but everyone is really welcoming and the program really does make it easy to integrate. I would say that you should just try it out! If it doesn’t work out for you, you always have the opportunity to stop. We have another novice meeting tomorrow at 5, so you can join us then. DM me or email gunn.sd@gmail.com with specific questions or to get more info about how to join."

And while I can't speak on the behalf of everyone, I am unsure if the term \"bicurious\" is considered 100% acceptable these days. But regardless, you're still quite young (assuming you go to this school), so don't let all of these terms and labels confuse you or weigh you down; just allow yourself to be yourself!"

    content: "Bicurious basically means that you're mainly attracted to one gender but also have some vague curiosity (shocking, right?) about another gender. From people I've heard who've described themselves as bicurious, they define it as \"mostly straight/gay but with occasional thoughts that contradict that,\" and most of them would be unlikely to actually follow up on those thoughts in terms of a relationship (though some people say they'd make an exception if they met someone really outstanding.)\n\nIf that sounds like it describes you, then you might be bicurious.\n\nAlso, I think the spectrum of female bisexuality (from no attraction to women to about equal men/women) goes like this: straight -> bicurious -> heteroflexible -> bisexual."

I have been studying for the SAT for the past couple months and started seeing a lot of improvement in my test scores (up to 1560) but I just can't get myself to concentrate on it now. I can't make it any higher since I was getting perfect scores on math before and now I am not even though my reading/writing scores are improving. To make it worse I took another practice test today and didn't do as well as I could and got yelled at by my dad for not taking my future seriously and that I am a disgrace.\n\n#GunnConfessions10924"

For a while now, I’ve been equally attracted to men and women, but always considered myself straight. It didn’t occur to me until a couple of years ago that this could mean I’m bi. The problem is that I definitely can’t picture myself in a relationship with a woman (I’m a girl) but I can picture myself with a guy. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship. I like to think I grew up in a pretty accepting environment, but is this internalized homophobia? I’ve thought about this for way too long and I just can’t figure it out. My parents are super accepting and so are my friends, which makes this situation even more confusing.\n\n#GunnConfessions10915"

    content: "I think for many people, asking these questions in the first place is part of figuring yourself out. \n\nAs for not being able to picture yourself dating a woman, there are a few possibilities:\n-You have sexual attraction to women but no romantic attraction\n-You haven't met a girl you could see yourself in a relationship with yet\n-You haven't seen that many examples of women in love with other women, and so it's hard to imagine what it would look like\n-I don't love the term \"internalized homophobia\" because it makes it sound like you're afraid of yourself (though some people might feel that way), but some people do repress the desire to date girls based on worry about how family/friends/society would react\n-Some combination of the above, or none of the above, or something else\n\nBased on your class year, it sounds like you're a sophomore? There are definitely people who take longer to feel set in their sexualities. Thinking it over can help, but so can just taking the time to experience life. Watching movies/shows with LGBT+ relationships can also help people figure out if they could see themselves in one.\n\nTake it easy and good luck! :)"

- content: "10827. [2021] Hopefully, I'm not too late. But heading into senior year, I've realized that I've dug myself into a hole that I hope someone can help me out of. Upon moving into the area and going to Gunn, my friendships were far and few between to say the least. Being in a new high school where the competitiveness was far beyond what I had ever experienced and with zero prior friendships made me feel isolated and unsure of where I belong. In the end, I made a few somewhat friends that I can talk to.. but no one I truly \"know\" . Never did I really have a circle of people or let alone 1 or 2 people I can just hang out with. I tended to drift between a few groups here and there but I never connected. I can't say I've ever met up with people at anytime outside of class for anything either. Last year, I cant say my situation got any better. Staying quiet seemed like the only way to avoid the awkwardness of barely knowing a single person in all my classes while everyone else seemed to know each other. I never found a place to settle for lunch, thus resorting to the library to get ahead in class or joining clubs to pass the time. Furthermore, quarantine has limited my ability to talk to the small handful of people I slightly know. Looking forward, I don't want my last year of high school to be one where I walk into a classroom clueless about every single person in the room. In my old high school, I knew practically everyone and could openly converse with them. In my current situation, I'd be lucky to know your name. I loved being a true friend to people. I want to be able to talk to people and have stupid conversations again. To be able to discuss anything and make inside jokes and have a good time. I'm sorry if this sounds overly-dramatic, but I'm trying to change. I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad for me. I recognize that only I am to blame for my situation. But, I don't think I can take being another year of feeling like I'm spectating my world. I hope some of you reach out... I'll try my best to overcome every instinct in my body that says \"they don't know you, it would be so awkward.\" \n\n#GunnConfessions10827"

- content: "10824. [2020] @10780 honestly my last post was just a jumble of unorganized thoughts because I was frustrated about all the confessions about how affirmative action completely invalidates hard work/“achievements.” (Side note: your opinion on the 50/50 gender ratio in engineering colleges is completely valid, but I am still curious why many people are so outspoken on opposing affirmative action but not against the 50/50 gender ratio engineering/CS admissions. These two issues, in my opinion, are comparable.) After reading these articles, I amend my original argument.\n\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2020/01/20/the-achievement-gap-in-education-racial-segregation-versus-segregation-by-poverty/ \n\nhttps://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/A_Shared_Future_Chapter_24_Interdependence_of_Housing_and_School_Segregation.pdf \n\nI’m not sure if I still agree with how affirmative action would benefit a poor African American more than a poor Caucasian or Asian. It does seem unfair to the poor Caucasian or Asian. At the same time, though, how do you undo all the racism and segregation against black people? Housing segregation still exists. Segregated schools still exist. Both of these are no longer mandated, but they occur naturally because black people are more likely to be in poverty. And this segregation then perpetuates the cycle of poverty. Because all of this is as a result of historic policies, it just seems like we have so much debt to pay to black people, and since college lends so much more individual and economic opportunity, why not employ some sort of policy benefitting—if not certain racial minorities—income groups?\n\nAnd to the comments on my original post:\nI agree that affirmative action will not fix the root problem of “education disparity.” Quality of K-12 public education is linked to funding, a lot of which comes from property taxes; that’s why schools like Gunn have so much money—even affording tanking CAASP testing participation—when sister schools in lower-income neighborhoods do not. Right now, with the way public education funding is structured, there’s no easy shortcut to providing all children, from a young age, the “opportunities they need to be successful, education wise.” Your perspectives are admirable but idealistic. In the long run, this is the goal, but just because this is the long-run plan does not mean that there should not be short-run plans correcting the current inherently unequal education system (in addition to also acting on the long-run plan, of course).\n\nThe Asians basketball/football analogy is interesting, but basketball/football is business—businesses exist to make profits—whereas college is not. And while there may not be “openly racist rules/laws targeted at African Americans” anymore, there are still the unfortunate repercussions I mentioned above. With your SAT argument and beliefs against representation, I can only assume you want college admissions to only consider SAT (a KNOWN reflector of socioeconomic status) and other loaded achievements...not sure what I can say to you. If there were 2 equally qualified presidential candidates with the exact same platform/policies/etc and the only difference being gender, I would say right now that I would vote for the female one. Because I want my younger sister, who dreams about becoming president one day, to see someone who looks like her in the presidential seat—to have someone she can look up to and aspire to follow. Representation is important and I don’t think that makes me sexist (though it is a bit of a different issue with the 50/50 gender ratio in CS/engineering admissions because of differences in qualifications between applicants).\n\nSORRY FOR THE LONG RANT. I guess I’m saying maybe affirmative action is not the right policy. Maybe it would be more equal to have some sort of policy based on income or another measure of socioeconomic privilege (but even then, the people who oppose affirmative action because it “invalidates” their achievements will still be mad, since their family incomes will then “invalidate” their achievements). I don’t think arguments like “college admissions is too late to create equality of opportunity” is enough to counter some sort of equalizing policy; if the system is not currently able to provide equal opportunities from birth, then it should at least try to “correct” some of the inequality later on, even if the correction is not enough to make up for the first inequality.\n\n#GunnConfessions10824"

I self studied though and wrote many, many pages of notes, but I didn’t end up using most of it. I still thought the questions were pretty straightforward. Basically, I’d say go for it if you know the material and like what you’re learning. "

- content: "10784. Reposting by request of 10166:\n\nIt is June 2, 2020. Right now, we are caught up in the midst of intense discussions of race to an extent that none of us have seen in our lifetimes. George Floyd was MURDERED at the hands of police and the nation—heck the world—is responding in full force. We are seeing mass protests, riots, and widespread social media posts rallying against a broken system that actively oppresses Black bodies on a daily basis. Society may be up in flames, but the issue of race is in the national spotlight and we are finally paying attention. For many of us, the shock of what is happening has opened our eyes to our silence, our complicity, and our racial prejudices. We have signed petitions, donated money, educated ourselves, protested, and pledged to take action to combat racism within our own lives. \nBut too often, the passion that we feel in the heat of the moment fades away as time goes on. Yet, racism is an ACTIVE, ONGOING, structural problem that does not disappear with time. Fighting the system requires us to stay vigilant and attentive. So let me ask the future:\nHow has society changed? Have all four officers that killed Mr. Floyd been convicted and sentenced? What have our state and national leaders done to correct the systemic flaws that allowed countless Black bodies to die at the hands of police? Did anything even change?\nWhat have YOU done? Did you stick to your pledge to correct your complicity in perpetuating the system? Have you witnessed any acts of racism in your life or around you—did you remain silent or did you intervene? Did you have that tough but necessary conversation about race with your parents or friends?\nBlack Lives Matter is not a one-time temporary trend, so don't treat it as such. If you posted it on your instagram story, you better hold yourself accountable. True change requires continuous solidarity. I desperately hope that that is what we'll see in the future. \n\n#GunnConfessions10784"

    content: "You should talk to your friends, imo. You can word it pretty similarly to how you worded this confession - \"sometimes I get super excited about a passion of mine and want to talk about it with you guys, and it makes me feel bad if you make fun of me for it.\" They might claim it was no big deal or that they were joking (no one likes being told they made someone feel bad), but if they respect your feelings, they'll make an effort to stop.\n\nAnd if they keep making fun of you, you can say something like \"well I think it's cool so I'd rather you not make fun of it\" because it's possible they're in the habit of it now for whatever reason.\n\nIf they value making fun of you over not making you feel bad, then I think you should probably stop talking to them as much (or stop talking about your interests with them if you don't want to cut off contact?)"

- content: "10780. @10767\nI'm confused. Yes, income is closely tied to race, but there are poor Asians and Caucasians in the United States, just as there are wealthy African- and Latin-Americans. Is your argument that poor African-Americans should be considered worse off than poor Asians as a whole, or that admissions can't be \"\"race-blind\"\" in order to be truly holistic?\n\nMy perspective is that requiring race be provided on an application tends to introduce MORE stereotypes and discrimination into college admissions than not. No race is a monolith, and entire groups of people should not be viewed with one lens because of their genetic makeup.\n\nAs a girl interested in STEM, I would rather engineering schools not simply favor girls to get a 50/50 ratio. I imagine admissions officers are probably looking for different qualities in the guys they admit and the girls they admit, which I'm more divided on.\n\nI don't really agree with confession #10726 either, because it assumes that in order to be successful you need to attend a good college. If someone is super smart or works super hard, they likely have the skills required to succeed later in life regardless of the college they attend. But it'd be nice if smart, hardworking students weren't (on average) punished in the admissions process just because as a whole, their predecessors have been financially successful. It's kind of a slap in the face, especially to those who don't come from wealth.\n\n#GunnConfessions10780"

    content: "I've only taken AP Econ (with Linsdell) and American Classics Honors of the ones you've listed. \n\n===American Classics H===\nAny English class in terms of strictness of essay grading, amount recommended to participate, etc. will depend on your teacher. \n\nThe reading material was about equally complex/involved as previous honors english classes. If you haven't taken an honors english class before, basically do the reading on time, ask occasional questions in class and don't procrastinate on essays. For vocab, Quizlet is your friend. \n\nThe overall class gets a 3/10 in difficulty from me, mainly because I found the other classes I took (like AP Lit) much more time-consuming and stressful. That doesn't mean honors English was \"too easy\" or a waste of time or anything like that! English classes at Gunn were some of the most fun classes I ever took.\n\n===AP Econ===\nFor econ, I'd put the class difficulty itself at 4/10 and the tests at a 7/10. You don't need a ton of mathematical knowledge to succeed, and the content is presented linearly enough that if you pay attention/take notes, you'll do fine. The reason the tests rank higher in difficulty are because they were worded confusingly at times, there's a bunch of preparatory material/notes you can fill out for a guaranteed bonus 5% on each test (but it took me like 3 straight days with about 3-5 hours per day to finish them), and Linsdell's tests were worth 91.5% of your grade back when I took them, which is a lot of pressure on each exam even if you do well during the rest of the class.\n\nTo be looked favorably on in class discussions, don't eat too much in class if at all, don't be late, don't cut class, try not to roast anyone/the teacher too much, and don't be disruptive. Those seem like common sense, but they especially matter in this class (at least, when they were in person. Maybe it won't matter over Zoom.)\n\nPS: (I probably only got an A- 2nd semester because of the bonus participation grade she gave me for showing up on senior cut day)\n\nFrom what I've heard, many of the classes you plan to take this term are kind of time-consuming (particularly stats), so I'd only take APES if you're genuinely interested in the subject matter."

I’ve been talking to my parents and trying to figure out if there’s somewhere I can move without paying a full rent or anything and we’ve come up with some ideas, so I might be moving out to a different part of the country. Part of me thinks I shouldn’t because I should take the time to be with friends (socially distanced and safely ofc) as we all suffer the same fate of being online. However, the other part of me just cannot fucking stand it here, I don’t have any privacy or way to be independent and I just want out (esp bc my incredibly toxic mindset from a few years ago has lowkey come back bc of how stuck inside I am).

    content: "Easy pasta recipe that's really good:\nBoil a decent amount of salted water in a pot. \nWhile that's boiling sliver 4-5 medium-sized cloves of garlic and shred some Parmesan cheese.\nWhen your water is boiling, toss in about half a pack to a pack of spaghetti depending on how many people are eating.\nHeat some olive oil in a medium-large sautee pan over medium-high heat, and toss in your garlic when it's hot.\nWhen the garlic just starts to brown add some red pepper flakes to the pan to toast them. Take it off the heat when the garlic is browned, making sure not to burn it.\nAs for the pasta, make sure you take a cup of the pasta water before draining it and put it aside, it will be important later. Also to avoid overcooking your pasta it should be a little underdone.\nPut your garlic and pepper flakes pan back on the heat and add your pasta in. Add your cheese and stir until it's incorporated. Add pasta water to emulsify your sauce, or make it all come together. Make sure you boil off the pasta water in the pan with the heat so you don't have wet pasta. Enjoy!"

Focus on understanding the fundamentals so you can reason your way through topics as it gets more complicated (and ASK QUESTIONS both to the teacher and to friends that are smarter than you).\nPersonally, I also am not sure that trying to learn the material over the summer will be the best use of your time, especially if you get OC, as much of the class is devoted to dispelling the kind of misconceptions you might get from self-studying.  \nAs for how it’ll differ online, I think the OC experience is very dependent on in-class discussions, so you’ll probably learn a lot less unfortunately.

- content: "10592. Dear parents,\nI know I am competitive and can be insincere sometimes but it’s not all me. I’m not blaming it all on you and the kids in my classes but you guys have caused a lot of it. I love competing and that’s why I play sports but I don’t need to be compared to others! I know I have older siblings I haven’t forgotten and yes I remember they’re grades not because because everyone else does but because ever since my siblings even started middle school you would tell us all of their grades, I’m not even a senior yet but yet that one B I got in history for my quarter grades in freshman year. I am aware that I go to Gunn high school but that doesn’t mean that you need to add to grade sharing experience, I’m that it affects my GPA but it’s not like I was going to get into the school of my dreams; you constantly say that I’ll never go to college, that I will never move out, and that I’ll be living at home even when I’m 40. \n\nYes I have a B as a quarter grade and I shouldn’t feel bad about it but thanks to my upbringing I now know I’ll never get into an Ivy League school. Just tell everyone about my grades but don’t complain when I say that I don’t like this family! Tease me about my grades because at least you will know one of the many things that affects me EVERY SINGLE DAY. Mental health disorders, longing for close friends, doing well in sports, wondering why everyday I wake up and I feel empty, and of course my future. It’s not like I’m going to share that with you! \n\nBut of course, go ahead bully me about my grades not being as perfect as my siblings and wonder why I act rude to you guys occasionally, it won’t change anything! People live longer when they are happy so hopefully I live past 50. I’m not ungrateful or spoiled no I’m depressed and I won’t except your help. Now to change anything about what I think about, you would have to hypnotize me. Thanks for everything and I mean it all the great and fun parts and all the horrible parts that I would run to my friends about if I felt close to any.\n\nPs. When I’m older I’ll try to pay back the money you invested in me so you guys don’t think I’m a disappointment \n\n#GunnConfessions10592"

    content: "You know emptiness is a symptom of depression? Parents bullying their child is problematic. Maybe it can be chalked up to their own insecurities and expectations they have of themselves. I know my mother would be unhappy if she got a B in a class. Whatever it is, you’d need a family therapist to help u address the problematic behavior of your parents. I know the therapist would tell your parents how inappropriate it is to compare their children. As for the friends thing, I’m sorry but I can’t help an anonymous person. "

Probably not true for all girls, but I feel like if I started wearing makeup on a regular basis, I wouldn't be confident in my own face anymore and would feel the need to always wear makeup. It seems like it would be a constant cycle of insecurity perpetuated by societal standards of beauty for women. I'm not trying to generalize to all people, but I'm saying that societal standards do affect us and we similarly perpetuate societal standards whether consciously or unconsciously and whether you want to believe it or not. Even if you believe you are the standout, I think this fact should be acknowledged...But I do agree that guys might care about appearance as much as girls; in the US, it's probably just that societal standards of masculinity prevents many from outwardly showing it.\n\n[#GunnConfessions10572]\n#GunnConfessions10579"

While it's important to remember that sex is a crime for people under 18, I haven't read about anyone getting arrested for it unless there were pictures/videos involved. Legally, I recommend waiting, but realistically, I don't think there's much harm done if people are discreet, respectful, and consensual. (And emotionally ready for it, but I'm not the one to decide that for people.)\n\nI'm also not a big fan of pushing hard rules like \"it's a crime; don't do it.\" People need to understand why these laws exist, what reasons there are to abide by them, and what risks there are if they choose not to.\n\n(On the subject of sexual pictures/videos of oneself, though, taking them is a terrible idea. If you're under 18, you've committed a crime as soon as the picture exists. If it leaks, which is always a possibility even years after, it's humiliating and can get you fired. I could elaborate more, but that's a separate post.) \n\n[#GunnConfessions10565]\n#GunnConfessions10576"

- content: "10563. I saw Miss Ichikawa at a grocery store in Palo Alto yesterday. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything. She said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying.\n\nThe boy at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Ma'am, you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear him, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\n\nWhen he took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, she stopped him and told him to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After he scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting him by yawning really loudly.\n\n#GunnConfessions10563"

    content: "Counseling:\n-ask your high school counselor, older students, or current professors if you can get a hold of them. They're generally much more up-to-date on what a school is like than people in our parents' generation.\n-come up with specific questions to get information better suited to your needs\n-don't go on forums like college confidential or reddit; they're very stressful\n\nApplication:\n-See confession #10527\n\nEssay writing:\n-Write when you feel least self-conscious.\n-if you have a bursty productivity style, write as many essays at once as possible until you feel tired. Then pick them up the next day and clean them up.\n-Edit by reading aloud, printing/writing corrections on paper, or giving them to non-biased editors.\n-If you have trouble coming up with ideas, write a list of everything you've done that you feel proud of to look at for inspiration.\n-Feel free to submit similar essays to schools if they're about yourself (for example, your 5 essays on why you love playing violin will probably not read super different), but don't just use the exact same essay over and over with a few names changed.\n-Tailor essays about the school to the school using research you've done and communications you've had with students/professors there\n\nBonus:\n-If you feel a sense of dread when you think about getting admitted to a school, like you'd feel obligated to go but wouldn't want to, then don't apply.\n\nThese are very broad subjects, so if you have more specific questions feel free to submit them."

Here are the details of the latest reopening plans that the board will consider approving on Friday (there might be a few changes):\n\n* Gunn will start out with full distance learning with a reevaluation on Sept 11 to see if it is safe to go back on campus\n* Grades will be assigned\n* Attendance will be taken\n* There will be synchronous classes (AKA live Zoom classes)\n* There will be limited opportunities for small groups to meet on campus (these include select clubs and courses)\n* Other extracurriculars/clubs are available in socially distanced settings (most likely Zoom meetings)\n* There's not yet a final decision on sports \n* look at Ovinus's comment for the proposed bell schedule"

I can't express how annoyed I am at people who think its ok to go out with friends, be in the same car, have get togethers by the beach, and go to restaurants, and having parties and other stuff. I have seen soooo many people doing this, and that's only what I see on social media. It hurts, and honestly it sucks. I know its a hard time for the class of 2020 but that does not give us the right to be ignorant and cause a continuous spread of the virus. This will keep going on forever if you keep this up. I want to hang out with my friends and family, and im not going to lie this situation has given me a great deal of anxiety and just gloominess, but I make sure to do so safely if I'm going to (with a mask, etc.). My grandmother who lives in Europe recently contracted COVID, she is only 65. She has asthma, and frankly we have accepted that this probably won't have a positive outcome. You never know when hardship will hit you... it caused a lot of pain for my family. It's real, and it's scary. It hurts me knowing that people don't fully understand that. Stop being ignorant. Wear your mask if you're seeing friends. Wear your mask when you go out. Stay in as much as you can. Show respect to your elders and health care workers who are working so hard to stop the spread. I just want everybody to be safe and healthy so we can get out of this situation as soon as possible. Please. Save yourself and your family while it's still possible. \n\n#GunnConfessions10517"

By that I mean no one is judging you for the college you choose to go to.  If someone does, they’re probably insecure about themselves in some aspect of their life and they aren’t worth your time.  The only person who knows what school you should be at is you.  Trust yourself and disconnect from the toxic culture we have at Gunn when you’re deciding.\n\n#GunnConfessions10515"

I want everyone in our class to ACTIVELY make an effort to not be toxic and mindful of what we say regarding colleges such that everyone feels accepted. With some work I think we can become the class that ends or at least reduces the toxicity around colleges at Gunn. No college is a bad college if it’s the right fit for someone and community colleges, especially the ones around us, are amazing. When college acceptance season comes around we should all make sure that we hype each other up over whatever colleges we commit to. \n\n#GunnConfessions10505"

    content: "As someone who’s been through substance abuse, rehab, and the whole 9 yards, I second talking to her. Sit her down with other family members. Tell her how her drinking makes you feel. Tell her what it does to you. \n\nI have a friend whose mother is an alcoholic, and another thing is making alcohol/drugs less of something the person wants to turn to. Try to spice up her life with things to do besides drinking. A lot of people originally turn to drugs bc they have nothing better to do. I mean for your Mom, I don’t think that’s fully true anymore, considering she’s addicted but still try to make her life more interesting. Do things with her like going hiking or running or something else, it’ll benefit her a lot, benefit you, and benefit your relationship.\n\nThis might get me slack, but NEVER get the courts involved unless she’s actually committing crimes like DUIs. If you want courts involved, tread lightly. Court mandated rehab doesn’t work for everyone, especially people that don’t want to make change. In many instances, it makes the situation worse. Convince her to make a change, because of everything it causes for the family."

- content: "10481. I think that the Palo Alto community as a whole needs to wake up to the very real fact that there is a prevalent sexist and rape enforcing culture present within our schools which PAUSD does nothing to combat. Nobody realizes how many Title IX cases PAUSD has messed up even in the last couple of years alone. They haven't gotten better at dealing with complaints of harassment since they hired a Title IX coordinator, they've just gotten better at brushing these complaints under the rug. Someone needs to seriously look into all the admin who have been messing with students' mental health and denying them emotional and mental wellbeing and safety at school by ignorantly dealing with their cases. Last time I checked, educators work to defend students, not the reputation of the district. The hiring of a Title IX coordinator in PAUSD is addressing the issue of sexual assault in the same terrible way that the useless self program was introduced at Gunn in order to address the issue of suicide.\n\n#GunnConfessions10481"

While arguing or voicing one’s opinions on the internet generally does not change anyone else’s mind (and in that way I agree it is pointless), it’s important to have some sort of outlet for your opinions. Actively writing them down gives you a chance to think about them and can keep you from continuously reinforcing your own beliefs. I think you’re missing the point of having anonymity."

Pls tell me what you think, I want to hear your opinion if you disagree.\n\nACA-5 will lead to discrimination. Race-conscious admissions will favor Black/latino people at the expense of asians. Race should not be a factor in admissions, and here's why. If you say asians are 'overrepresented' at UCs and therefore demographics should be fixed, consider why they are. Is it because asians tend to be more affluent? Then the factor you should be considering is socioeconomic status, not race. There are poor asians that will be hurt dearly if you choose race as a factor, simply because there are a lot of rich asians who are more privileged. Similarly, black/latino kids from wealthy backgrounds might get an unfair advantage even though they haven't faced as much hardship as black/latino people from underprivileged communities. Please, please think about this. Ending race-blind admissions isn't necessarily a good thing.\n\n#GunnConfessions10451"

- content: "10446. Unpopular idea: antinatalism. Basic proposition: Although we cannot ascribe a lack of consent to that which invariably cannot give consent (a child being born), it is manifestly the case that children are being born unto unfit conditions for good health and fulfillment. We are born unto a world with strict natural conditions but the privileges with which we are endowed greatly constrast. Thus, it bears a great responsibility on copulating pairs to appreciate the applied conditions they would bestow on a child. The very inequalities that you might recognize today are only furthered by a proletariat that reproduces at considerable rate. In courtesy of that which is predictably the case (a child being born unto a low-skilled laborer life conducive to dejectedness and an absence of freedom for self-growth), it's sensible to refuse reproduction. Should a desire of two be of greater significance than the preset suffering of one? Particularly when it is the result of those very two folk that indulges this prophecy? Hope for a brighter future is a poor rationale. Would you purchase a vehicle in hope that it functions? A child gets no refund on its life. Red bean popsicles are good.\n\n#GunnConfessions10446"

- content: "10417. So... there's a girl on instagram who posts pictures from protests and literally uses her own voice in the BLM movement despite not being black. While I admire that she's trying to be a leader, and she has good intentions, she is sort of overpowering. Like she was chanting \"I can't breath\" and posting things saying \"let me educate you\" as well as leading protests with a megaphone then a few days later posting pics with her friend. I'm glad she's trying to be an ally but she's not necessarily helping when she's the one leading the protests and chants. We need to be there for black people, yes, but if we use our voice louder than theirs then it further proves the point that only white people can lead or make a difference. We are here for support, not to lead. We need to elevate and amplify black voices, and allow for them to be heard. If you know who you are, maybe we can have a talk? I don't want you to go off at me or \"cancel\" me but I'd love to have a two way convo about what you're thinking. Thanks. \n\n#GunnConfessions10417"

    content: "With all due respect, this post is so profoundly wrong that not only did it miss the mark, the mark isn’t even in sight. The notion that protesting and deconstructing racism’s systems is a task incumbent on its victims, rather than those that benefit from such systems is logically underpinned by the insidious assumption that racism is, or is more of, a “black people’s problem.” Such posturing is specious, counterproductive, and in no small part why racism has festered in this country for so long. Racism, while only tangibly harmful to POC, is morally caustic to everyone, and while black people should never be silenced in these movements, they should NOT be the sole voices. Frankly, your insinuation that the presence of my co-organizer’s voice negated or silenced mine inherently because I’m black and she’s not is deeply offensive and belittling. Black voices and non-black voices can both coexist and be respected in this movement, justice is not a zero-sum game. The atrocities of racism should be equally appalling to everyone with an in-tact moral compass, and in turn, everyone should be using their voices as loudly as possible, whether that involves a megaphone or not.\n\nRegards, The BLACK Co-Organizer of June 6th’s Protest "

We all lived in an extremely privileged area and even if your family is not wealthy, you benefit from the education system. Which is also a result of inherent racism because property taxes determine each public school's funding. \n\nIf you're Asian (like I am) and don't understand why Black people are getting attention when we have also been subjected to racism, look up what a model minority is. Each minority has a unique experience in the U.S, and this movement isn't claiming that we don't face racism. \n\nIf you don't think that the police system is corrupt because you've never had a bad experience with a cop, think about why that is. The world is so much bigger than your own experience. We all have inherent biases and it's important to recognize this within ourselves and our friends. If you hear someone say something offensive, even something that you might think is harmless like saying the n word while singing a song, CALL THEM OUT! It's not harmless because it reinforces stereotypes and just because it's written in a song doesn't mean that you're allowed to say it. If you think this is too hard to do, get over yourself and stop being a righteous ass. I know that many of you are working on doing all of this and have put in a lot of effort to change yourself during these times. Keep it up :) You guys make me proud, and I know you'll kick ass in life.\n\n#GunnConfessions10406"

One other note: yes, outdoor dining is allowed, but only with members of the same household. "

- content: "10391. [2020] As an Asian dude, someone who’s supposedly hurt by affirmative action the most, here are my thoughts on ACA 5. I honestly support it, sure there Asian’s who feel marginalized, but I think the fact of the matter, at least, within Palo Alto, is that there is so much academic privilege compared to the cons that it shouldn’t matter to anyone applying to college. I’ll try not to generalize too much but let’s make a pro and con list of being Asian in Palo Alto\n\nPros:\n-We’re pretty much a majority in this city, with the culture seeping through pretty much everywhere\n-Living in Palo Alto implies a pretty great wealth, which means that\n-Food is on the table every day\n-Pretty much no extracurriculars are off the table\n-You can afford $5000 dollar SAT classes \n-Expensive personal tutors for your hard classes\n-Despite all the negativity directed towards the teachers, they are pretty much all overqualified in some way and we are incredibly lucky to have such great teachers on the faculty\n\nCons:\n-You might get docked a little when it comes to applying to college\n\nI’m not trying to say that being born with wealth means that you don’t suffer. Personally, I suffered with mental health issues all throughout high school. However, I am saying that academically, it’s an area in which many of us are so privileged that it’s completely out of line to victimize ourselves and say that “muh college spot was stolen!!!1!!!”. As well, you’re also making the assumption that the underrepresented minorities are somehow less qualified than you are, when in many cases, you don’t know what their story is, and how they are just as qualified as you, or even more qualified to attend a certain college. It’s so incredibly tone-deaf to say that you are at a net disadvantage in the college admissions process when you’re so blinded by hate that you can’t see your own privilege.\n\n#GunnConfessions10391"

    content: "I love how you assume every Asian that supposedly goes to a school in Palo Alto meets all those factors you listed. Horrible way to justify anything imo. Just because you may be an Asian that was privileged to receive personal tutoring and the ability to participate in expensive extracurricular activities does not mean other Asians will have a similar status. \n\nYou also seem to disregard the whole situation in play as well. While Asians are generally well noted and better off on average compared to other ethnicities, some Asians are not well off and are in very similar financial situations to the very poor.\n\nAffirmative Action is the definition of inequality. I don't get why you're trying to defend that.\n\nAlso, it is fucking stupid to justify affirmative action because of our privilege. What was the purpose of our immigrant parents working day/night jobs and sacrificing their youth to provide their children a better education opportunity? Why are we being punished by that? There's a clear difference between acknowledging the \"privilege\" and using \"privilege\" to play the \"victim-card\"."

Just saying, not all Asians are privileged, even in Palo Alto.\nAlso, my family was poor when they first came to America. We had to live in a shitty apartment in the hood in New Jersey. Then when we got to Arizona it was a little better but still basically the same. My Mom finally spent all of her life working to be a doctor and now she is one, now she earns a good amount even though most of it is taken by taxes, my brother’s tuition, and mortgage, to name a few."

The use of different gender pronouns doesn’t make much sense, and in fact, it is actually conforming to gender normitivity. Instead of adding extra pronouns, we should expand the definition of he/him, and she/her. \n\nGoogle actually gives a good answer about what gender is. “either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones. The term is also used more broadly to denote a range of identities that do not correspond to established ideas of male and female.” \n\nWhy adhere to the cultural and social differences of he and she? Instead of adding new ones - which will always make it seem like they/them are different people - we should focus on expanding the already established ones to be more inclusive. \n\nI’m always open to other people’s opinions. So if I’m completely wrong, let me know in the comments.\n\n#GunnConfessions10384"

Preconceived ideas of gender and centuries of tradition aren't exactly easy to change), it would still force people to choose between two options and stick to one permanently. I think \"they\" provides a comfortable third option for people who don't feel comfortable with any current gender stereotypes.

This effectively means that UCs can have a preference toward underrepresented minorities. BUT, a preference of one race, even if “fair” is fundamentally discriminatory against those who happen to be of another race. And you know who is most ‘overrepresented’ according to the UCs? Asians. That means that they will treat ME differently simply because of my ethnicity. That is fucked up. And they are championing this under the guise of ‘equal opportunity’. But that is literally the OPPOSITE of equal opportunity for admissions. It means that they can prefer applicants over Asians because there are ‘too many of them’ getting in. If you want to address fundamental inequalities and inherent racial bias in the system, do it. But don’t do it by creating more.\n\n#GunnConfessions10374"

Are you really going to stay silent when you KNOW that there are rapists crawling around on campus? Just because you're worried about being accused of bullying? I hope you realize that rapists don't just rape once. They will continue... Look at Nicholas Zhao. He has sexually assaulted SEVERAL girls, and will keep doing that until someone stops him and punishes him accordingly.\n\nAnd if the school system wants to write off sexual assault cases, do NOT stop fighting. Don't stay silent. If we raise our voices and push for change, it will come. Please don't sit there and say \"friendly reminder, but we can't do anything...\" that is simply not true. If you think that people shouldn't speak up, it shows that you don't actually care about the past and future victims that will suffer at the hands of rapists. If you know rapists, please SPEAK UP and keep doing so until something is done! That's all.\n\n#GunnConfessions10370"

This also applies to the group of Gunn seniors who went and took graduation pictures together at Gunn/Stanford, blatantly violating all social distancing measures. I know that social distancing is putting a lot of stress on people, but couldn't you all have just waited until a later to take the photos? At least you could've followed the guidelines and worn masks? What the fuck makes you think you guys are any different than the other people who have been following the rules? It especially sucked that many of those in that group are members of SEC, who are supposed to be the school role models. You know who you are. I really want to go to college in person in the fall and in part due to your actions that is looking less and less likely. \n\n#GunnConfessions10368"

One senior this year has three restraining orders for stalking his female classmates and another has sexually assaulted two girls, and while both were reported with multiple witnesses and evidence, neither faced consequences.

    content: "It seems that, since the author of this post is not referring to a specific current court proceeding, they probably mean they want the standards of legal proceedings to be applied outside the courtroom. Due process is a legal term. It doesn't mean that you, as an individual, continue to pretend nothing happened when someone appears 99% likely to be guilty. You are not a court of law; you don't need to give people the benefit of the doubt like one -- and many of the people arguing for justice wouldn't necessarily look to the court of law as the paragon of justice that those arguing right now for \"due process\" for rapists seem to think it is.\n\nPeople are hurting, right now, because this rapist walks free, several years, at least, after some of his crimes. Where is their \"due process\" -- especially when this case fits into the pattern of an estimated 99.5 percent of rapists getting off with no jail time (RAINN)?\n\nFurthermore, even if we were to all, unnecessarily, attempt to personally emulate the disciplinary systems we are calling on to act, I don't see how our conclusion could be anything other than a guilty verdict. UC Berkeley, one of the main institutions that needs to discipline Zhao, uses a preponderance of evidence as their \"standard of proof for all hearings\", clarified as \"defined as 'more likely than not'\" (UC Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct, 2.d.5). This differs, notably, from the US Criminal Court standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Again -- you are not a court of law, and you don't owe people the same rights that a court of law does. But if you look at 20+ accusers who all have horror stories about the same person and think that isn't a preponderance of evidence, then I'm not sure where to start.\n\n(For a further discussion of how the term \"due process\" is misused to protect rapists, harassers, and other abusers from consequences, I recommend this article: https://medium.com/the-establishment/due-process-is-needed-for-sexual-harassment-accusations-but-for-whom-968e7c81e6d6 )"

A teacher watched some of this happen and told me she was going to have to report it, for my safety and well-being and they were required to by law. When I got pulled into the office I decided I wasn’t going to be quiet anymore and it took a lot of courage to explain what happened / been happening. I dealt with this case for about a year and a half. Admin (mainly Ms. Laurence) chose to ignore this situation and not punish the people who had done this to me. Even though there was evidence of video cameras, my statement and from another teacher. It still fucks me up to this day about what happened and how it was handled. Gunn admin needs to change and actually hold people accountable for their actions. It truly disgusts me that Ms. Laurence was fired from Paly for covering up the rapes / sexual assault that happened there and she didn’t learn her lesson and did it again. She and the other admin need to be held accountable.  \n\n#GunnConfessions10348"

Hentai has some of the worst animation I’ve ever seen. It’s just motherfucking loops playing over and over again with the same awkward ass angles. The character design and anatomy is always horrendous. The faces all look the same(weird and derpy) bro I swear the same studio makes all the hentai. The titties are always mofucking yoga ball size. That shit ain’t hot at all it’s just disturbing to see those enormous udders on a skinny ass mf. And some times there fucking milk squirting out BRO THATS NASTY BRO GTFO WITH THAT SHIT. I’m an ass guy and the hentai industry has no love for us at all. It’s all about those disgusting titty team low lifes with their gargantuan knockers. Bro it’s either those ginormous titles or fucking loli shit MISS ME WITH THE LOLI SHIT NUFF SAID BRO. I think I’ve only seen one hentai with amazing animation and art. I forgot what it was called but it was about some swim team guy with a swimsuit fetish. Very nice masterpiece. Anyways don’t even get me started on the plots bro. BRO WHY IS EVERYTHING ABOUT UGLY BASTARD AND NTR CUCK SHIT BRO WHAT THE FUCK. If I see some ugly old fuck I just click off real quick. But that’s like 90% of all hentai what the fuck. Give me some vanilla shit bro the FUCK. All these shitty ass hentais have gotten me to the point where I would rather read some hentai manga than watch fucking hentai. I would rather be staring at my tiny ass phone screen reading the tiny ass text on hentai manga than watch fucking voiced, colored and animated shit shout out to my boy nhentai best website. The only problem with hentai manga is that there’s so much yaoi shit. Now I’m all for lgbtq+  and shit but not in my nhentai feed for jackin off. I guess the moral of the story is to stick to 3D porn.... thx for coming to my ted talk\n\n#GunnConfessions10345"

Just make sure you are applying to schools you genuinely are interested in going to. When I applied to UC Berkeley out of Foothill College, I didn’t think I would get accepted, but applied anyway. I’m sure glad I did because I got accepted and that’s where I ended up going. So, definitely don’t shortchange yourself or fail to apply to a school out of fear. Diversify your pool, aim for a few reach schools, and make the best decision from there once you find out where you get in. That’s my advice. Good luck! "

The industry is predatory; it feeds specifically on young disenfranchised women, chews them up, and spits them out. Rates of depression, drug overdose, and suicide among active and retired adult film actresses are incredibly high, indicative of the dishonest and exploitative conduct that many in the industry are known for.  Whether or not they \"like eachother\" isn't particularly relevant when one party is being exploited and lied to for the other party's gain."

You hear stories of false accusations from girls ruining the lives of the guys, and it's pretty disgusting hearing about these false accusations.\nIn this case, with 20+ people coming out, I absolutely fucking 100% believe that he should rot in hell and be expelled and all this other shit. I don't doubt the credibility of the statements because there's an overwhelming number of people coming out right now. Anyone who still has doubts at this point should really reconsider their position. Unless there's substantial proof that this is a coordinated effort from 20+ people to deface him (which is INCREDIBLY fucking unlikely), then the accusations are most likely legitimate.\n\n#GunnConfessions10335"

- content: "10330. [2020] I think I understand was 10313 was saying. NOT that he ISN’T a rapist, but—at least from what we know from katie hui’s ig story and the change.org—not ALL of the 20+ women’s testimonials included rape. They included a range from “rape, sexual battery, groping, sexual coercion, menace for speaking out, child pornography, and other non-consensual actions.” I am in NO WAY SAYING IT’S ANY LESS BAD. I just think especially in situations such as these that it’s super important we read carefully to really understand the stories and hopefully work to solve the issue so these horrible things can’t keep happening—and also not further divide ourselves when we’re (I think) on the same side of the issue and need to work together (eg post 10313)\n\n[#GunnConfessions10313]\n#GunnConfessions10330"

Apart from the alleged victims, none of us can know for sure right now if he is guilty, but you'd have to be crazy to not be very convinced that he did some horrible stuff."

- content: "10322. Follow up to #10313...\n\nYour point about that case is well taken. What you’ve described is, in fact, rape, and I think it would be fair to characterize Nicholas Zhao as a rapist.\n\nHowever, my contention wasn’t mainly that Nicholas Zhao is not a rapist, although I will admit I hadn’t read that particular testimonial. Rather, my point was that I fundamentally disagree with the ethos of these kind of click-baity headlines that sacrifice truthfulness for attention-grabbing flashiness. At best it’s terrible writing, and at worst, as I’ve said before, it takes points that have merit and makes them wholly untruthfull. In much the same way as it would be an awful idea to charge George Floyd’s murderers with first degree murder as it would result in the aquittal of criminals easily guilty of a lesser murder charge, it is counterproductive and stupid to make claims you have no intention of being able to back up, even in something as simple as this petition.\n\n“Nicholas Zhou has been raping women (over 20) since high school” is a statement that sets up a petition for failure! The response of anyone who clicks on that only to NOT see 20, much less over 20, testimonials that would consistute rape is to distrust the petitioner!  Clearly the petitioner has no problem lying in the title/link of their petition in the interest of garnering signatures, what’s to stop them from lying in the contents of the petition itself?!\n\nNow, in this case I very much believe the people who have come forward and I support action against Zhao. But it is precisely because I am on the side of this petition that I implore people, generally, to adopt a truthful dispotion in what they say. Never has an argument been made stronger by lies, nor weaker by telling the truth.\n\nFinally, Merriam–Webster is a laughably flaky dictionary that as recently as four days ago agreed to change the definition of racism at the behest of a woman seemingly out of 1984’s newspeak department: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/merriam-webster-racism-definition.html. \n\nThe UCR definition of rape, and the law of this country, is not so loosely goosey as to be possibly confused by the obtuse with non-consensual handholding, and will remain next week despite any emails that may be sent to the justice department: \n\n“The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.”\n\nI am of the opinion it is in the interest of women’s-rights advocates to adhere to this definition of rape and not toss the word around lightly, so that it may have power and meaning when it is actually called for, as in the case you’ve indicated. But there are certainly not 20 such testimonials that would meet this criteria and it weakens the petition to say otherwise. Further, it is hurtful to actual victims of rape to use a wide definition as it equates lesser traumatic acts of unclear consent with violent, traumatic acts by a real rapist.\n\nI write all this in the defense of language that I see is slowly being perverted in much the way Orwell foreshadowed in his 1946 essay—an essay which made all the points I’ve made here only more eloquently and with more efficient prose—Politics and the English language.\nThis kind of definition-changing to suit an agenda is a first step in the decline of free speech. The next step will be the censoring of opinion pieces in the press as the New York Times has just done, but that’s an argument for another day... \n\n[#GunnConfessions10313]\n\n#GunnConfessions10322"

    content: "Ok, ok, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The title of Katie Hui's petition is \"Immediate expulsion and legal action against Nicholas Zhao for assault and rape.\" I have no idea where \"'Nicholas Zhou has been raping women (over 20) since high school'\"  came from. It's certainly not the title of the petition, nor is it stated within the petition. Also, it's Zhao, not Zhou. \n\nLook, two can play the game of being overly pedantic in expressing opinions. Is this the right place or time? Absolutely not. Get the facts right first, please. \n\nAs for addressing the rest of your post, I defer to Cindy's comment."

    content: "Hey hey hey... at this point nobody cares about what your \"contention\" is with this event. No like, seriously, step outside and just gaze into the distance and think: is what I am focusing on remotely relevant or important? \"I fundamentally disagree with the ethos\" why the hell is that the case? I don't know about you, but if a normal person doesn't believe that he did it, they would look further into this issue (like I did). And that absolves frankly any of the so-called \"inaccuracies\" you have with an understandably impassioned person outraged by this situation. \n\n\"Never has an argument been made stronger by lies, nor weaker by telling the truth\", if we go by your interpretation of what is a lie and what is a truth, then that statement is not true. \"Nicholas Zhao raped 20 women!\" is a far stronger rallying call than \"Nicholas Zhao may have possibly raped a portion of the 20 women he sexually assaulted, but the remaining portion of women he only engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with that does not involve penetration of the genitals or whatnot\". Can't you fucking see that obviously by bogging down this entire overdue process of calling for action against him with such trivialities, you are obfuscating this entire effort in meaningless crap?\n\n“Finally, Merriam–Webster is a laughably flaky dictionary” what the fuck is even a dictionary for then? There is no reason for a dictionary to stay constant. And you realize that depending on the context, the meaning of words can differ? In popular consciousness, any sort of non-consensual sexual activity IS rape. This petition is obviously not in the court of law, nobody gives a crap about what the exact technical differences certain words mean. Like we understand you are not braindead enough to lose the ability of Googling, so no need to fucking drop that UCR definition to show that you can.\n\nI am not going to take a “true” rape less seriously if you start to describe other non-penetrative forms of sexual assault also as “rape”. Why the fuck would I do that? Like your argument that it weakens the “real” rape victims’ cases has no bearing on reality; furthermore, how can you definitively say a sexual assault w/o penetration is less traumatic than one with it? This is a very problematic assumption to make.\n\nYou are not “writing in defense of language”. Language has ALWAYS been this way, nothing is being perverted. In fact, YOU are perverting language by engaging in arbitrary pedantry that serves a thin veil for your out-of-touch attitude toward life. Please talk to real people for once and realize that nobody cares about the meaningless distinctions you are making.\n"

- content: "10304. [2022] In response to Neha over post 10290:\nLong read, but if you actually care about the issue then...\n\nIn the first sentence of said post, it was stated that the death was \"wrongful\", a statement which is accepted by nearly everyone in society. No one is defending Derek Chauvin's actions, and even given the highest benefit of doubt, he is still very clearly in the wrong. Kneeling for 3 minutes on the neck of an unconscious individual is murder. \n\nHowever, the point stated in the post seems to be this: Derek Chauvin is a criminal. This does not justify going door to door, finding everyone remotely tied to him (including the rest of the Minneapolis police force), and attacking them over \"institutionalized and systematic racism.\" Rather, the crime stays with the criminal.\n\nIn the same way that the whole African American male population is not attacked over the 50 percent of murders and ~35 percent of all violent crime.\n\nIn the same way, democratic politicians, who advocate against drastic methods to stop the inflow of illegal immigrants (just making illegals legal will not change the types of people that are coming over without allowing for acceptance of immigration petition), are not attacked over the fact that federal and state prisons in the United States are made up of over 25% criminal illegal immigrants. (No one said not pushing a zero tolerance policy was at fault, but rather the lack of producing any drastic measure of restraint on illegals).\n\nLastly, it is important to address your claim that police are encouraged to be brutal.\n\nFirst off, police are human too. And especially in shitty neighborhoods, they are essentially going to war. Every day they drive around these neighborhoods expecting to get into gun fights. The only difference is that in war, you know the enemy. In these neighborhoods, you are never allowed to see the enemy and fire first. In addition, the \"enemy\" in this case are American citizens. Naturally, in this urban war, police make tactical mistakes such as going to the wrong door on a no-knock warrant, which resulted in the owners of that home firing in self defense, police firing back, and Breonna Taylor accidentally being killed (not racial incident). This is the reason why police are harder to prosecute, just as it would be hard to prosecute a soldier who wrongfully killed a civilian of another country during wartime. They are doing a difficult, dangerous job. Again, this is a general truth about the difficulty of prosecuting police, not a justification of the disgusting act by Derek Chauvin.\n\nNot to mention, I would like to ask that you provide a single case in the last ten years where policies are \"rooted in systemic racism\" or ESPECIALLY trained \"to adopt racist strategies.\"\nJust try. I highly doubt such a training method or racist policy exists (except for maybe affirmative action). \n\n[#GunnConfessions10290]\n#GunnConfessions10304"

    content: "Since you don’t seem to believe me unless I show my sources, this will have several articles for you to refer to. First, you seem to have misunderstood who I find at fault in our policing system. I am sure that there are a large number of cops who do their jobs with the intention to really help their community, but it’s their system that militarizes them, directs them onto tasks they are not equipped to do, trains them insufficiently, and backs them up if they commit racially-motivated violence. You seem to be unable to remember a racist policy/training by the police. Stop and frisk and qualified immunity are both problems in the system that encourage racial profiling and protect racist cops respectively. If you want to learn more about the “roots” in systemic racism that I talked about, this is a good start: https://theconversation.com/amp/george-floyds-death-reflects-the-racist-roots-of-american-policing-139805 . The “war” mentality you mention is one of the reasons we should maybe rethink the way we are structuring the police. If the solution to violence is violence, that keeps the cycle going. \nThe “type of people” that come as illegal immigrants are far less dangerous than you believe: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/upshot/illegal-immigration-crime-rates-research.html . In addition, this famous 25% statistic uses a definition of “criminal alien” that includes legal immigrants: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/15/lisa-boothe/republican-strategist-says-25-percent-inmates-are-/ If your statistic came from another source than the one cited in the article, keep in mind that an alien is anyone with nationality in another country and a criminal alien is an alien who committed a crime. Lastly, if you really want to make a point, don’t hide behind the curtain of anonymity. Learning (on both sides) can only really happen with a conversation, and hiding behind the safety from backlash and from owning your opinion really doesn’t help with anything. If you want to have a discussion, be a part of that discussion."

[Gunn parent!  ] This is in response to #GunnConfessions10283, the student whose mother is forcing her to major in CS.  \n\nI'm a parent and would usually never think of posting here, but in this case I feel the need to speak up.  I experienced something very similar a few decades ago when I was your age.  I suspect that like me, you are a second generation child of Asian immigrant parents.  \n\nThe only person who should decide what you do in your career is you.  You--not your mother, not your father--are going to be the one spending your waking hours for many, many years working in your career, so you'd better have an interest in what you're doing.  \n\nRelated to this:  the idea that you somehow need to follow your parents' plan for your adult life because they \"sacrificed\" for you is manipulative garbage.  Becoming a parent myself had made this very clear to me.  My spouse and I care for our children, talk to them, spend countless hours with them--because we love them and because that's just what good parents do.  Raising kids does not incur a \"debt\" that needs to be \"repaid\".   Being able to spent lots of time with my kids under the same roof is a precious phase of life that will end all too soon.  Having these years and building a close relationship with my children are the single best experience of my life.  It's all the \"repayment\" that I need.  \n\nImmigrant parents are coming from a different perspective than you are.  They arrive in this country as non-native English speakers with heavy accents, and they cannot hope to completely understand American culture, humor--or the American job market and economy.  Not surprisingly and with some justification, they think their only path to financial stability is a purely technical career: doctor, engineer, anything where being really good at taking tests and doing math will get you far and where personality, communication and other soft skills don't matter as much.  \n\nBut you are American, and you have doors open to you that your parents aren't even aware of.  Similar to you, my parents pretty much made me major in something technical in college.  But I never had an interest in the subject and after graduation, I immediately took things in a more business-oriented direction with my career.  When I went to grad school, I made sure I paid for it myself so that I could make all my own decisions about what I studied.  In the end, things have worked out pretty well for me.  \n\nI'm sure your mom loves you and only wants what's best for you.  But *you* also want what's best for you.  Making your own decisions and charting your own path in life is the only way to become a full-fledged adult.  This country is filled with sad, frustrated 2nd generation Asian American doctors and engineers who dutifully chose careers according to their parents' demands.  On some level, they exist in a state of stunted maturity, unable to act as fully-functioning adults, forever in the shadow of controlling immigrant parents who made so many \"sacrifices\" for them.  Don't become one of them.  Choose your own career, and live your own life!  \n\n#GunnConfessions10302"

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen ice cream cones in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the cones and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical interference,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each cone and put them in a cardboard holder and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by screaming about malarkey really loudly.\n\n#GunnConfessions10299"

[2020] From The Economist: \n\n\"Pessimism is self-defeating, too It is a short step from thinking that America's original racial sin is so deep that it cannot be overcome, to thinking that smashing and burning things is justified, because it is the only way to get attention. Yet if today's protests slide into persistent rioting, as in 1968 after Martin Luther King's assassination, the harm they cause could be felt most keenly in African-American districts. Those people who can leave will. The left-behind will be worse off, as home values plunge and jobs and shops disappear. The police may withdraw, leading to an increase in crime, which in turn may eventually bring more violent policing. The scars will be visible for decades...When rioting takes hold, those who support the protests may find that their demands for change are drowned out by the clamour for order to be re-established.\"\n\n#GunnConfessions10287"

I feel like a lot of “us” minorities aren’t able to join cheer, dance, or even hoco just because we never interact with other races. I am not only going to blame “Gunn” but I feel like It is very important for people of color to represent and show where they are from. \n\n I don’t like the fact that a minority Hispanic group is called Mexicans when you don’t even know where each one of us are from. Hispanics are not only from Mexico. Educate yourself.  \nI apologize if I repeated myself and I know this whole thing is all over the place. \n\n#GunnConfessions10276"

I think it’s unfortunate that we still see racism in some individuals but I feel like liberals are being too extreme about it. I think every circumstance was different in these killings and we should judge it individually, not on our PD or nation as a whole. I personally think the officer that murdered George Floyd should be given the death penalty, he was acquitted before on charges of 2nd and 3rd degree manslaughter. Don’t hate on the police, the men are in blue are risking their lives to protect each and every one of you. I think the PD deserves more respect than this and we shouldn’t be chanting fuck the police. Most of us don’t have the toughness to be an officer. I fully believe that all lives matter, but I believe that people need to realize that there were some bad instances. Also we are advised during terrorist attacks to not judge an entire religion by the actions of a few lunatics, yet we seem to judge an entire police force by the actions of a few lunatics \n\n#GunnConfessions10262"

ACAB stands for all cops are bastards. the term “bastard” is taken from the words bastardize and corrupt. with that in mind, every single cop takes an oath to up hold all laws. every cop chooses to uphold the system. there are some unjust/corrupt laws. the system itself is corrupt. so every single cop has taken an oath to uphold those unjust/corrupt laws. every single cop is choosing to uphold this system.\n\npeople say “blue lives don’t matter” because cops CHOOSE that profession. they CHOOSE to uphold that system. cops can take off their uniform. POC cannot take off the color of their skin. cops have the privilege to quit their job to take themselves out of “danger” that they chose to be in. POC do not have the privilege of quitting their race to take away the possibility of racially motivated police brutality. POC, especially black people and hispanic people, have to live their lives everyday wondering how they need to react if they are pulled over. how to react if an officer approaches them on the street.\n\nso i’m really, truly sorry that “liberals are being too extreme” about a system that has been built on racism. im so sorry that the liberals huwt your feewings."

    content: "i personally believe protestors are rightfully outraged and legally expressing their right to peaceably assemble. also really? seeing racism is just “unfortunate”? innocent lives are lost due to this racism; it’s more than just unfortunate—it’s immoral. the institution of the police as a whole has been built on racism, and continues to perpetuate a racist sentiment through both brutality and a lack of consequences for such brutality. ( https://theconversation.com/the-racist-roots-of-american-policing-from-slave-patrols-to-traffic-stops-112816 )\n\nalso, at the end you’re implying that you’d prefer to assume that all muslims are terrorists, but you’re advised not to and therefore don’t? muslims (and other brown ppl) are still facing the repercussions of 9/11, something they had no part in. police are finally being held responsible for the abuses of power they’re allowed commit because of the system. you can’t compare the two at all."

You can’t work the way a racist system wants you to work and be a good person at the same time. I have no doubts that many cops joined the force for the right reasons, but I truly don’t think that they can do their job how they are supposed to while following strong and good moral guidelines. All cops are bastards, but some are still good once they take off the badge.\n\n#GunnConfessions10259"

[2021] As an Asian American female, I get where y'all are coming from when you say that there should've been more action taken when it came to hate crimes against Asian Americans because of the pandemic. The hypocrisy of the people who slandered us and then showed support for the BLM movement needs to be pointed out. However, we must consider that in general, our circumstances are very different. This may be an unpopular opinion, but the resurgence of hate crimes against my race is short-lived compared to the multitude of hate crimes against the Black American population that have been occurring for 500 years due to systematic racism. We are often perceived as the model minority, and with that comes privilege. I don't have to live in constant fear of being targeted by the police. When there's a burglar at my house, my first instinct doesn't have to be, solve it yourself because bringing a police officer in might risk your safety. And that's the difference. This movement is protesting police brutality and racism that is skewed toward our Black American population. It's not just about George Floyd's murder, but the murders of thousands of Black Americans by the police that have gone unnoticed. We are protesting policy here, we are protesting the mistreatment of Black Americans by a group that is meant to protect us, we are protesting the widespread institution so that our fellow POC's can live without being in constant fear, without being discriminated against like they have been for centuries. We should unite to support our Black American population so they can support us in the future.\n\n#GunnConfessions10230"

If you keep ignoring racism towards Asians, the same system we are now fighting for African American will be set up for Asian American. \n\n#GunnConfessions10225"

- content: "10222. I wholeheartedly agree that the death of George Floyd was a national tragedy and an abhorrent stain on our national pride and unity. As an Asian American, I believe that it is our moral duty to stand with the African Americans against the systematic injustice and oppression imposed by the implicit bias of police officers and the corresponding overreaches in recurring episodes of brutality, and I am sure much of my community parallels my views and my drive to catalyze change. \n\nTo be sure, African Americans have seldom lent their aid to Asian Americans in times of crisis, and sometimes they have even perpetuated Asian American misfortunes--as with the LA riots of 1992, where African Americans infamously targeted Koreatown and other Asian Businesses in LA based on the shallow and specious ideology that Koreans posed a cultural and economic threat, an ironically xenophobic sentiment coming from a fellow racial minority that seeks to break down racial barriers. Further evidence of African American apathy and even injustice against Asian Americans is present in the more recent COVID-19 pandemic, where African Americans not only stood as silent bystanders while Asian American-owned stores were being vandalized and robbed, but also were caught on camera physically attacking elderly Asian Americans and women in a cruel form of revenge. It seems that when it comes to fighting for the advancement of African Americans, when minorities should band together in solidarity against oppression, Asian Americans often end up with the short end of the stick--fighting for widespread, non-race-specific justice that seems to eventually culminate on an African American focus to the detriment of Asian Americans.\n\nYet, we retain hope. We trust that America was the land of the free that our parents immigrated to. We trust in the American dream. We trust that this is the land of the free. At the end of the day, we are all Americans, and the only way to get through this is together. For these reasons, we choose to overlook the past and turn only to improving the future, for African Americans and for all races. In a country of immigrants, of foreigners, of minorities, we choose to stand with African Americans and continue to support our fellow minority brothers and sisters, for the good of the country and for the good of Americans. Together, we fight your fight.\n\n#GunnConfessions10222"

It’s really neat to see ALL the seniors from the Palo Alto schools celebrating together around Palo Alto. \n\n(also Ms Borgen came down from Seattle which made it even better)\n\n#GunnConfessions10211"

- content: "10205. hi, I have a few questions about things i've been seeing. these are all just so that I can better educate myself about what's going on. \nfirst, i've been seeing a lot of people use numbers to censor words, and I was just wondering why. i saw on youtube videos made for donating ad revenue that you shouldn't explicitly write \"streaming\" because youtube will take away views, but I've also seen this in other places. should everyone be doing this, and if so, are there specific words and times when you're supposed to do it?\nsecond, I've seen quite a few comments on posts showing cnn videos saying that people don't like them or support them. I also saw that the cnn building in atlanta was vandalized, and based on articles I've read and pictures I've seen, it seems to be a part of the protests (but please let me know if it isn't). is there a particular reason for this? when I've tried to look it up, the only articles I can find is how trump doesn't like them, so is it particular political, racial, religious, etc. groups that don't like cnn? and would supporting them and using them as a news source be detrimental to the blm movement? \nfinally, i've been seeing a lot of book and film recommendations to educate yourself. a prominent one I've seen is white fragility: why it's so hard for white people to talk about racism. would people recommend this for non-black pocs? based off the title, it seems like it's directed towards white people, but if it's still a good way to learn, I would like to read it. on a related note, some of the books on these lists are available with the pausd overdrive thing, so if you can't or don't want to spend money, i suggest starting there! (but a lot of them are checked out right now, so you might have to wait)\nthanks in advance to anyone who answers these questions, they're purely for my own curiosity and education. please don't feel obligated to answer any of these, and if they are offensive topics, i'm truly sorry. i just want to do anything i can to help, which includes educating myself.\n\n#GunnConfessions10205"

For example I'm asian I talked to another asian friend they were surprised I didn't drink boba and did \"asian\" things and said I was whitewashed? Other examples hearing an african american talking without slang and their african american friends would tell them they are not black enough. How does that make sense? It's like people put these labels on themselves because they are peer pressured from other people from the same race or gender. There's also the thing with males, we aren't encouraged to cry. Why because that's \"feminine\"? How is that feminine that is a human emotion. I feel like people like to put labels on everything and people feel peer pressured to act a certain way to fit in.  \n\n#GunnConfessions10203"

Yes everything that has happened to our fellow African American brothers and sisters is freakin terrible. Change needs to happen and I’m continually trying to do my part by staying educated and donating. But to see some of you say it’s just property and that looting is okay makes me sad. I’m not thinking about department stores or chain restaurants I’m thinking about immigrant small business. A lot of you were already born in America and your parents were already established citizens when you were born so you fuckin don’t know the struggle of moving to a country with literally nothing. Everything in these business aren’t just items. They represent months of work and food on the table. So fuckin check you privilege when you say that vandalism is okay. Show up to protest but also show up for the cleanup after and defend these small businesses. \n\n#GunnConfessions10202"

- content: "10197. [2020] 10177\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I’m Asian.\n\nI think the coronavirus hate crimes, while horrible, aren’t quite on the same level as what happened to George Floyd. Most of the Asians that were attacked weren’t killed, and the perpetrators of all of the attacks were charged with assault or murder. We can condemn the crime, but what else more can we do? We can educate people and maybe protest, but that’s about it. There isn’t really much we could’ve done to prevent racist people from hurting Asians. People are being charged and they’ll likely be convicted for their stupid racist acts. \n\nPolice killing Black people is a bit different. For one, police and white people who kill black people aren’t held accountable for crimes like this. This entire movement is about holding white people and especially police accountable when they commit murder. There are multiple policies that would prevent black people from being killed by police and others. I don’t think super egregious misconduct and injustice by police or white civilians happens to Asian people (except maybe to Muslims).\n\nI also think this movement is about holding police accountable which keeps all people safe. Police kill about 12 times as many civilians as the other way around. Making them less trigger happy would help all races and all people.\n\n[#GunnConfessions10177]\n#GunnConfessions10197"

Since the loosening of Title IX rules came up a bit before George Floyd was murdered and racism took center stage, I think there should be talk about racial bias in sexual assault proceedings. Evidence shows that black men accused of sexual misconduct by white women are far more likely to be found guilty and face disciplinary action than white men or men accused by minority women. Of course, that is not to say that the accusations by whites against blacks were false, or that the accused white men were guilty, but this is something we should all consider, as we must not perpetuate racism in the fight against sexism and sexual violence.\n\n#GunnConfessions10194"

I know this is going to be controversial, but I truly cannot believe that I'm seeing so many posts calling me privileged because I'm upset that innocent lives are being taken and destroyed in these riots. I too am disgusted by the systematic oppression of POC and want to see justice and change. However, there are occupied buildings with children and innocents alike getting burned down and then blocked by rioters who don't want to let the firefighters help those inside. There are random people's cars getting smashed on the freeway. There are small businesses, already suffering from the economic impact of COVID-19, getting destroyed, looted, or burned down. There are shop owners who are being beaten and killed simply for trying to defend their own store. When are people going to realize that participating in or defending these horrific events makes them no better than the people they are angry with in the first place? We are in outrage over the lives of innocent black people that are being taken, but it's suddenly okay to endanger the lives of children and fellow BLM advocates? I see so many Gunn kids posting/commenting defending these riots, but if you really want to talk about privilege and ignorance, do you think your opinion may be different if it was YOUR family's store being looted and destroyed? If it was YOUR parents that were being burned in their own home? I honestly cannot understand how so many of you are defending this. I understand that everyone is feeling desperation and helplessness, but I genuinely believe in my heart that there are other ways. There HAS to be. It's actually heartbreaking to see what our country has come to. We've already lost over 100,000 lives due to COVID; please stop encouraging the loss of even more. \n\n#GunnConfessions10176"

- content: "10175. [2023] I think there are a lot of people who see what’s going on right now and only are upset about the looting and that is wrong. Of course the looting is bad, but you can’t write off the whole movement just because of it. A lot of the people doing it aren’t even with the cause and are just taking advantage of the chaos to do wrong and I’ve seen many instances of actual protestors stopping those people. The vast majority of protestors are peaceful and their cause is to end unnecessary violence and killings by police. When all attention is brought to the small minority of detractors as if they represent the whole movement, like the police are doing, it puts many innocent people in danger of being hurt or even killed. Please, if you truly care about the welfare of the people in this country, stop hyping up the looters and just donate to businesses harmed if you can. I am in no way trying to justify their actions, but we need to stop giving them a platform.\n\n#GunnConfessions10175"

Wielding a gun for the first time in a chaotic situation is basically asking for negligent discharge so, unless your parents have previous firearm training, consider nonlethal alternatives like mace or baseball bat. I can understand how you feel, if protests get violent, police have more pressing issues than protecting your house. If it helps, you can also come up a plan in case your house starts getting attacked; having a plan can help you feel more in control and safer. Comment on this or something if you do decide to go through with it, I know someone who legally obtained a firearm for home defense after lockdown.\n\n[#GunnConfessions10148]\n#GunnConfessions10167"

- content: "10166. A message to the future (someone please repost this in the fall):\n\nIt is June 2, 2020. Right now, we are caught up in the midst of intense discussions of race to an extent that none of us have seen in our lifetimes. George Floyd was MURDERED at the hands of police and the nation—heck the world—is responding in full force. We are seeing mass protests, riots, and widespread social media posts rallying against a broken system that actively oppresses Black bodies on a daily basis. Society may be up in flames, but the issue of race is in the national spotlight and we are finally paying attention. For many of us, the shock of what is happening has opened our eyes to our silence, our complicity, and our racial prejudices. We have signed petitions, donated money, educated ourselves, protested, and pledged to take action to combat racism within our own lives. \n\nBut too often, the passion that we feel in the heat of the moment fades away as time goes on. Yet, racism is an ACTIVE, ONGOING, structural problem that does not disappear with time. Fighting the system requires us to stay vigilant and attentive. So let me ask the future:\n\nHow has society changed? Have all four officers that killed Mr. Floyd been convicted and sentenced? What have our state and national leaders done to correct the systemic flaws that allowed countless Black bodies to die at the hands of police? Did anything even change?\n\nWhat have YOU done? Did you stick to your pledge to correct your complicity in perpetuating the system? Have you witnessed any acts of racism in your life or around you—did you remain silent or did you intervene? Did you have that tough but necessary conversation about race with your parents or friends?\n\nBlack Lives Matter is not a one-time temporary trend, so don't treat it as such. If you posted it on your instagram story, you better hold yourself accountable. True change requires continuous solidarity. I desperately hope that that is what we'll see in the future. \n\n#GunnConfessions10166"

    content: "Also most of the rioters aren't even involved in the protests they are just there to cause damage. There's video proof of protesters trying to stop rioters from destroying property and businesses. There's even a video of some rioter trying to get people to flip over a truck?? Yesterday there was a video of a guy driving his car into the middle of a peaceful protest in LA trying to set of fireworks which resulted in his car getting blown up because a protester threw it back. And recently a retired cop got killed by rioters and looters because he was defending his friends pawn shop. And I think that's not acceptable as well, I think that's on the same level of killing George Floyd because they didn't have to kill the cop at all. Because the cop wasn't targeting anyone he was just protecting his friends shop."

    content: "I don't think agree, I don't think rioting is acceptable since from other videos I seen and heard from people documenting up close to the rioters. And all the rioters weren't even focusing on the protest they were just focusing on breaking open stores and robbing things and their conversations weren't about the protest either they were about \"Oh do these jeans fit?\" and \"Quick take these stack of clothes\". And how does breaking into stores like Gucci help the movement at all? How does it affect the government? How does destroying someone's business going to convince the government to change? They'll probably see you as a lunatic breaking things for fun."

For the reason that I think most people in Palo Alto realize the reasoning behind the protests, and why they are important for minorities, I won't add on to what has already been said.\n\nBut as an Asian-American, the riots and the looting that follows scares me. Every time this happens, Asian-American people and businesses are ALWAYS targeted. This does NOTHING but invalidate any support much of the Asian-American community has for the original protest. Especially for many in the first generation - they have seen too many stores get robbed, family members mugged. They've seen their kids - the same ones they worked so hard to get a better life for - get attacked at school, often by African-Americans. It's disappointing for me to see so many people justify the looting or rioting, especially when I know who will be affected the most. The rioters and looters will get a pass, many of them will probably get bailed out by your donations anyways. But I suspect many Asian businesses will close and their owners will leave. I see tons of people support Black-owned businesses. That's good, but as seen in previous protests, those are much more likely to be protected by the people of the neighborhood. Those same people often won't step in if the Korean supermarket across the street gets smashed up. It'll only be worse because one of the cops was Asian.\n\nThese are the same stores and businesses that already are suffering because of racism stemming from COVID-19. They've already had six months of extraordinarily low business or no business at all, and now they will return to a store that was burned down. \n\nYour bail fund money won't help them at all. \n\n#GunnConfessions10149"

    content: "You’re unfairly victimizing Asian-Americans in a situation where we shouldn’t be victimized. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I haven’t seen a single case where a BLM protest has specifically targeted Asian-American people and businesses any more than other groups. Sure, Asian people and businesses have been harmed during these riots and will be disproportionately affected due to the effects of COVID-19 racism, but that’s not a reason to shame the riots or claim we are the true victims. The looting and rioting is an expression of the fear and anger that has come from institutional racism, a system where many of us get to choose whether we are the victims or the oppressors. You said yourself it’ll only be worse because one of the cops was Asian— doesn’t that make sense? Anti-black sentiments in the Asian-American community are commonplace. We get to be the bystanders to police brutality, then turn around and play the minority in the United States card. While racism against Asians is a serious issue, right now it’s more important to stand in solidarity with BLM. We are not blameless victims, and we don’t get to choose how they protest. "

    content: "arguably no racist laws on paper but a racist system still stands. The goal is equality within a system that is currently broken. The reason why protests haven’t worked in the past is bc people in positions of power have done nothing close to enough to fixing this. Socioeconomic divide exists but is further perpetuated in certain demographics due to the racist and broken system"

    content: "Nah I think you're right in a sense, if racism isn't systematic through laws, then its cultural. The protests haven't communicated a clear path to progress or solution, all they have really shown is outrage. I think its especially hard though because there is nothing easy to target. We cant just point at legislation and say \"that one, that one is discriminatory\". Instead, what this demonstration of general outrage IS doing is making alot of people stop for a second and think, \"is the way I live my life contributing to a culture which favors one race over another? Am I not a racist, but, furthermore am I anti-racist?\"... Which is a good thing. Still, we would get so much farther if we could organize a clearer message."

- content: "10128. Hi! Author of 10106. I just want to clarify some of the stuff that I wrote, I misworded some of it and it didn't come across how I would've liked. Thanks to those who pointed out that the rioting is a necessary part of protesting and getting things to change and that a lot of these protests start peaceful but are escalated by the police. I completely agree and was trying to refer more to the fact that some people are going further than that and burning down small businesses, many of which are owned by members of the community who are black (which I think #10116 addresses well). Of course, a lot of times these are started by instigators, rather than by those who truly care for the movement. However, it is sometimes continued by those who claim to be a part of the blm movement. Some people continue to justify this, saying that it's all in the name of the cause, and that's where I disagree. I've seen videos of protest organizers stepping in front of these \"extremists\" (for a lack of a better word. sorry if that's not the right word or offensive, I literally can't think of a word) to prevent them from looting businesses, including a Target in New York. If the leaders of the blm movement think what they're doing is wrong, why would we (a majority of whom are commenting from the comfort of their homes) think that it's right? \n\nTo Livia: I definitely don't mean to demonize the rioters and protestors whose actions are actually to enable change and to garner attention to the cause. I wasn't specific enough in my first post, and I apologize if my words came off like that.\n\nTo Sophia, Joyce, and Ryan: Once again, I wasn't as specific in who I was referring to as I should've been. You all make very valid points, and I meant to talk about those who are only trying to cause chaos, rather than fight for the cause. \n\nOnce again, I'm not trying to start any arguments, just clarify what I had written in my first post and address some of the comments I saw. \n\n[#GunnConfessions10106]\n#GunnConfessions10128"

    content: "It's performative though... Does it help the movement? No. It's just like those chains that go around sometimes like \"Repost this if you would care if I died\" it doesn't DO ANYTHING and the people who participate are just riding a clout wave. I'm not going to deny that they actually CARE about the movement, but they're certainly not helping it by making chains like this"

- content: "10124. For all those saying that peaceful protests are not possible, or that sometimes violence is required to initiate change, I invite you to believe in the possibility of peaceful justice. Many of those living during the time of Gandhi, MLK, and the woman's suffrage movement had no faith in the possibility of peaceful protests, but ultimately, human perseverence succeeded. Yes, it may take months or years, it may take the lives of protestors just as it did when British officers opened fire upon a field of peaceful Indian protestors, but those losses only go to further expose the corruption of the system. We have to understand that fighting violence with violence with the intention of restoring peace is hypocritical and counterproductive. The innocent lives of small business owners should not be the casualty of unnecessary violence, just as Floyd's life was. If your argument is that protestors should not adhere to the laws of a system that is corrupt, then at least adhere to your own moral compass - must we turn on innocent civilians, loot stores and burn buildings, all with the intention to end the perpetuation of oppression? It is our duty, as those advocating for an end to oppression and with aspirations for a peaceful nation, that we adhere to our own advocations and protest peacefully. After all, the future of this nation begins with us - do we really want to continue this cycle of violence?\n\n#GunnConfessions10124"

    content: "It’s not just about this attack, it’s about the consistent overpolicing and brutalization that black and brown people have faced from law enforcement for decades. And this is the third (reported) case in only a couple weeks of the murder of an unarmed, innocent black person at the hands of a police officer. But regarding this attack in particular, I’ve heard several cops say that you’re trained never to put pressure on a man’s neck like that. In any case, this man is a murderer, so there’s nothing to defend here."

I think a lot of you who are posting “you are the problem” type shit are really just trying to prove something. I think your logic is that if you call other people out you’ll look 10x more supportive or something. While I think the sentiment is okish, I think there are some problems. I think this is actually causing a worse environment for the people who haven’t already spoken up, and is making it harder for those people to speak up genuinely. Just think about what you post, and if you really feel like you need to do more, talk to people directly. When people talk they connect more, and change will come through connection.\n\n#GunnConfessions10121"

- content: "10106. What happened to George Floyd was terrible and not in the least bit acceptable. I support people protesting and those who are doing what they can to enable change. However, the measures some people have gone to in the protests are a bit too far. I know that someone already posted it, but committing arson isn't the way to go and it's not going to change things. The only thing that will happen is that people's prejudices against POC being violent will even further engrained in their mind by seeing these violent acts. Some people brought up the fact that Target has ties to the police, which I understand, but there are innocent people that rely on their jobs at these stores to support their family. Not to mention, an affordable housing development was also burned. People that support this cause may have benefitted from this, and now it's being taken away from them for no reason other than people are taking protests too far. Some people may say that this is just in retaliation for what the police have done to the people peacefully protesting, but don't fight fire with fire. George Floyd was described as a \"gentle giant\" by his family and friends, and while I don't know him, I can't imagine this is how he would want to be remembered. Say his name, don't tarnish it.\n\nI don't mean to start any arguments, and I respect other people's opinions, including those who believe that everything that is happening is necessary, I just wanted to share my opinion and see if anyone thinks similarly.\n\n#GunnConfessions10106"

- content: "10079. @10055 i agree that people shouldn’t be publicly shamed, but there should be some form of repercussions towards those who are willingly breaking social distancing. it’s unfair that some of us are going months without seeing family and friends in order to try to help flatten the curve and keep people safe while other people don’t seem to care whether or not they’re affecting the community, and maybe even their own family and friends, by blatantly disregarding instructions from the government and health officials. i understand that in some cases, seeing friends is very beneficial and needed for mental health, but tons of people are finding ways to do that without putting others at risk. i do know people who have lost family and friends due to covid-19, and it hurts to see people not trying their best to follow guidelines like most of us have to do. i can’t wait for the day that i can go out and see all my friends, but for now i, along with the majority of people here, am choosing to social distance to keep those very people safe and do the little i can to help.\n\n[#GunnConfessions10055]\n\n#GunnConfessions10079"

- content: "10070. Debate club member here! In response to Gunn Confessions 10061, I understand the impression that our club might not necessarily seem very welcoming. The reason a lot of us joined debate is to provide an outlet for argumentation, when eyes were previously rolled at us for arguing outside of debate. For a lot of us, it’s the one place where WE can feel welcome being ourselves and expressing our opinion freely. Obviously, I don’t speak for everyone in debate when I say this but I’m sure it holds true for a lot of us. \n\nIf I argue with you, it’s not because I think I’m better than you or want to show off my knowledge; it’s just a part of who I am. I am not trying to fit my passion of debating into other subjects, I’m just an opinionated person and will not shut up for the sake of simplifying a situation. That’s not to say that I have no filter; I’ve just finally allowed myself to express my opinions in and outside of debate. \n\nDebate is also a community in which I’ve found some of the most supportive people I know.  I did feel pretty intimidated by the way debaters conversed when I first joined the club. But some of the best people I know are in debate. Upperclassmen sacrifices their Friday afternoons to help me and other novices when we were freshmen and I have made close friends who helped me through some very tough times. With regard to the argumentative culture that many outsiders may find off-putting,I now realize that a lot of it is because we feel comfortable with each other and comfortable with expressing our opinions; it’s a sign of a close-knit community that encourages self-confidence.\n\nOnce again, I’m not trying to discredit 10061’s opinion, but I hope you understand that debating outside of our club isn’t something a lot of us can (or even want to) hold back, and it’s not something done with the intention of making others feel inferior. I didn’t write this with the intention to argue with you, I wrote it so you can understand it from our perspective. Debate is a place to express opinions freely, which is why this might carry forward into other parts of life. This club is inarguably one of the most welcoming communities I’ve ever had the privilege to be a part of, and a lot of it comes from honesty that may otherwise be interpreted as annoying argumentation.\n\n#GunnConfessions10070"

Then here you are suggesting we publicly shame them for trying to find comfort in their friends? I'm sorry if one of your family members or loved one has passed away due to Covid. However, you're ignorant if you think you understand everybody's circumstances right now.\n\n{#GunnConfessions10050]\n#GunnConfessions10055"

Find your own passion and join that club--not only is it easier to get a leadership position, you'll also find people that are interested in the concept and not just awards as a whole. Even if debate is your passion, consider joining another club like the Chariot which is still political but easier to get a position of power in. Don't waste your life on big clubs when you often won't be able to reap the benefits of the work you've put in, especially because a lot are extraordinarily biased and honestly very cliquey (including the advisors). \n\n#GunnConfessions10048"

Plus, with tons of people it's way easier to make friends because there's tons of different friend groups in each club. I do agree that there are people in all three of those clubs who aren't interested in the topic but are just interested in winning and getting awards though, and I'd say that if that's what you're looking for you won't get the same benefits as people who just want to make friends"

If you're letting external things like leadership positions and seemingly cliquey groups from ruining your passion, then that's not the club's fault.

They continuously tell me I’m not good enough because of my college’s ranking and comparing me to these Ivy League commits. My girlfriend keeps hurting me because she says the things I want from her will let me down. She tells me I mean nothing to her because I’m not next to her and doesn’t bother calling me. My sister comes home and starts destroying the living room in tantrums. I hate my life so much and talking to people has not helped a bit. I don’t know what to do.\n\n#GunnConfessions10018"

However, these students can feel confident that the email option will be in place for them during the makeup Exams.\nEmail submissions will not be available for the World Language exams.\n\n#GunnConfessions10004"

    content: "If you’re overwhelmed by the amount of colleges to look at, the Naviance filter really helped. If you’re still getting too many results, narrow it down to one area. For example, last summer my family wanted to look at colleges somewhere, so we decided to just look at colleges from the northwest. After that, using the filter on naviance, we were able to narrow it down to 5 colleges in that area. Then this past December, we were going to SoCal, so we did the same thing again for that region. It can really help to just break it down by region so you don’t get overwhelmed. Good luck with the searching!"

    content: "I was really worried as an underclassman cuz I’m indecisive and don’t have a singular passion.  To me, it seemed like everyone else had a life plan and I had no idea how to figure mine out.  I’m also a worrier, so I generally don’t believe people when they give me this advice, but I’m telling you so many things work themselves out over time... I’m so different now than two years ago or even last year, and the easiest way that I “figured stuff out” was just noticing things that happened naturally in my life.  When you come across an idea like a volunteer opportunity for instance, which opportunities naturally perk your ears up?  Even if you didn’t come out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a doctor or something, is there a common thread between all your activities that you maybe never noticed before (ex: even though I like business, it took me a while to realize that all my activities somehow involved teaching)?  Which type of work environment do you like?  I figured out that I love talking and writing, so that helped me cross off a lot of future paths that aren’t really collaborative.  Stuff like that!  And my DMs are always open— don’t worry, you’re less behind than it feels like sometimes :))"

    content: "If it were up to my wishes, I would be a full-time bridge professional. As it is, there are two problems with my dream. First, although currently there is money in bridge, it is unclear whether there will still be a substantial number of clients willing to hire professionals. Second, although I am already a relatively strong player, I am still nowhere near the level of the best players in the world, and it is unclear whether I will reach their peak. I hope I can, but it is not guaranteed. If I am not one of the best players in the world, although I may still make some money, I won't be getting opportunities from the wealthiest clients with the biggest wallets. \n\nSo like you not focusing on music as a career, I plan on not focusing on bridge for financial stability. And although we may not be able to make a living out of our passion, I think there is still value in pursuing it. If you get pleasure out of music, I say continue to enjoy it! I think it is passion and love, not a job, that gives meaning to life."

We are in the same storm, but not in the same boat. Your ship could be shipwrecked and mine might not be. Or vice versa.\n\nFor some, quarantine is optimal. A moment of reflection, of re-connection, easy in flip flops, with a cocktail or coffee. For others, this is a desperate financial & family crisis.\n\nFor some that live alone they're facing endless loneliness. While for others it is peace, rest & time with their mother, father, sons & daughters.\n\nWith the $600 weekly increase in unemployment some are bringing in more money to their households than they were working. Others are working more hours for less money due to pay cuts or loss in sales.\n\nSome families of 4 just received $3400 from the stimulus while other families of 4 saw $0.\n\nSome were concerned about getting a certain candy for Easter while others were concerned if there would be enough bread, milk and eggs for the weekend.\n\nSome want to go back to work because they don't qualify for unemployment and are running out of money. Others want to kill those who break the quarantine.\n\nSome are home spending 2-3 hours/day helping their child with online schooling while others are spending 2-3 hours/day to educate their children on top of a 10-12 hour workday.\n\nSome have experienced the near death of the virus, some have already lost someone from it and some are not sure if their loved ones are going to make it. Others don't believe this is a big deal.\n\nSome have faith in God and expect miracles during this 2020. Others say the worst is yet to come.\n\nSo, friends, we are not in the same boat. We are going through a time when our perceptions and needs are completely different.\n\nEach of us will emerge, in our own way, from this storm. It is very important to see beyond what is seen at first glance. Not just looking, actually seeing.\n\nWe are all on different ships during this storm experiencing a very different journey.\n\nRealize that and be kind.\n\nUnknown Author\n\n#GunnConfessions9899"

I could be on Xanax right now and it would be much worse than weed, but society sees it as a medicine and useful while weed is seen as harmful. What a joke.\n\n[#GunnConfessions9817]\n\n#GunnConfessions9877"

But that doesn't mean that someone whose parents were refugees from Vietnam shouldn't receive affirmative action compared to someone whose parents are wealthy Nigerian doctors. Affluence has a much larger bearing on the adversity people go through in life. That's the main thing affirmative action should be trying to equalize.\n\nWhy does the term POC even exist? If Asian-Americans shouldn't be part of the narrative in affirmative action, if they tend to have more income, education, and status than white people (long considered the status quo), then why is being POC like some badge of honor that means you've had a difficult time being successful? Why do people use a term that erases unique cultural identities - like taking all the world's flags and making them one gray blur - and summarizes all of race relations as \"white people vs. everyone else\"? I would appreciate more nuance in how race politics are approached in America (particularly on the left.) I feel like the more \"woke\" identity politics become, the more individual struggles are ignored in favor of a broad \"all x people are inherently worse off\" narrative.\n\nI am ready to be disagreed with. I have no idea why this idea is so compelling to people (besides the desire to help those in need. As if basing college admissions on skin color will do that.)\n\n[#GunnConfessions9837]\n\n#GunnConfessions9852"

- content: "*tw:ed*\n9846. [2020] to 9844 -\nHi, so losing weight can be great but it can also be very dangerous. \nI'll first answer your question - it is likely that most of the weight you lost is water weight, meaning that you didn't actually lose one pound in one day, because I am pretty sure it is impossible. \nLosing weight fast is unhealthy for a number of reasons: first, it probably means that you adopted unhealthy eating habits, which either won't last for long because the headaches, nausea, exhaustion, dizziness, inability to focus or think about anything but food, which are all related to a too low blood pressure which can be dangerous for your heart in the long term, and constant hunger will lead you to start eating again, possibly even more than you used to. The other reason is that without doing it gradually you will probably not have time to get used to your new healthier or slightly reduced meals which will prevent you from building healthy eating habits in the future, and can even lead do an eating disorder or depression, etc. \nYou most likely won't pass out even if you fasted for a whole day, but if you are starving yourself for months and exercise extensively there is a good chance that one day it will be too much and you will pass out, but please, please do not let it get there.\nIf you want to lose weight I recommend talking to your parents or guardians about it. They might not like the idea at first, but don't let that scare you - you should be open and explain why you want to lose weight, and maybe set a reasonable goal (although it doesn't necessarily have to be a number, it can also be in terms of what you want your meals to look like). The next step would be meeting with a doctor and a nutritionist, and I would also recommend meeting at least once with a therapist.\nIf your parents are not supportive, try to schedule a meeting with a nutritionist yourself. You can also try to talk with your friends for moral support :)\nI think that what I am trying to say is - do not do it alone. \nGood luck!\n\n[#GunnConfessions9844]\n\n#GunnConfessions9846"

And ideally finding a professional, who cares not only about keeping you at a healthy weight but also about how you view yourself. Some people offer virtual counseling or diagnostics for free."

I get that you may feel like you want to show your improvement through your grades, I am a straight A’s student and always strive for the best, but it’s not equitable to our community. There are kids who get lunches at school because their parents can’t afford the food. How do you think they are handling this situation? There are kids who don’t have fancy computers or unlimited data or even WiFi! So please just think about more than yourself during this time. Not everything is about you and your grades. My mom helps out in a kindergarten and first grade classroom four days a week. There’s one little girl in the class whose only devices at home that have cellular access are her mother and big sisters phone. How is she supposed to go to zoom meetings or see her teacher or classmates let alone do the work?! There are many kids in our district who live like that — all ages and grades. It’s not fair to complain about yourself not getting a letter grade when you have three full meals a day and access to the internet with out any trouble. Think about the kids and families around us who are struggling right now. Think about the people in our community who aren’t as privileged as some and how we can help them. Getting fricking letter grades isn’t going to do that. Colleges don’t care if you only have credit on your transcript, colleges are accepting credit/no credit on transcripts because, believe it or not they are dealing with the whole coronavirus thing too!! The whole country, really the whole world is facing this pandemic so stop freaking out about a fricking letter grade. What really disappoints me is that here in Palo Alto, a very progressive town with abundant resources has people who are flipping out about their child not getting a grade in their AP or honors class. It bothers me that in a society where we are accepting of all people, we are too thickheaded to see past a stupid grade, to the people who need the support. I appreciate all of the teachers who are doing their best to give everyone the best learning experience during this time and everything our district is trying to do for our community despite what some parents are saying. Like what the hell, stop just thinking about your special ass snowflake and think about the other kids in the district. Again, I’m not looking to anger anyone I just really feel the need to express this.\n\n#GunnConfessions9835"

    content: "I don't speak for all, but especially me, who struggled somewhat in freshman/sophomore year grade wise, this year was the year where I felt I could prove myself. This second semester was looking up as I reached to achieve that goal. With the change however, my transcript will no longer reflect my hard-work and therefore will change how colleges may view me. I am not \"thickheaded\" as you describe, I simply want people to know that I have worked hard to get where I want to be, and now that is no longer possible. Also, I would argue that it is incorrect for you to claim that people are too caught up in this subject to think about people in need. There have been plenty of efforts by just students alone to raise money for people in need during this troublesome time. Everyone is concerned about everything- placing blame or suggesting people are ignorant only spreads hate and does not help anything."

- content: "9825. *just something I wanted to share with you guys*\n\nTalk To Us\n\nDuring these hard times staying positive and looking at the bright side is important. But ignoring the downside is where mistakes are made and we lose touch with reality. It has now been a month since the “shelter-in place” order was enforced. During this time, PAUSD has completely halted all mandatory education including assignments, lectures, and any other content. But ever since it was announced school will not be reopening this school year, somehow it feels like no communication has been made with the students that actually attend these schools. As a sophomore at Gunn, neither the school nor the district communicated with us, the students. Many crucial events are coming up that have not been addressed. And the topics addressed by the district were done through a one-sided platform addressed by someone that knows nothing about us or our values. \n\nOne main topic PAUSD has worked on was implementing the “credit/no credit” system which allows students to get credit for a class without receiving a letter grade which would have affected their GPA. This alone is a good thing, but the district has repeatedly referred to the decision describing it with “no downsides” which only shows the lack of conversation happening between the district and the high school students affected. The “credit/no credit” system has a substantial downside, it takes away from the students who worked extremely hard this semester to bring their GPA up for it not to count. In addition, students taking AP courses also wish to benefit from the weighted GPA score which is also non-existent due to this system. These may seem like simple issues to the principals, admin, and district but for us this completely altered how we viewed our high school experience let alone our future. \n\nSecondly, there are many issues brought up by students that have been repeatedly ignored and pushed aside. One of the most frustrating responses to hear from the admin and district is “more information to come”, this simply is another way to push us aside including our opinions and values. Our lives keep moving, we keep getting closer to finals week, summer school, summer jobs, and starting a new year yet we don’t even know if these things are happening. Summer school is so important for so many students, we plan it years in advance, arrange all four summers around it, and wake up at 6:00AM to sign up just to be pushed aside and ignored. This school district was created to educate and guide us but somehow when we are struggling the most they decide to ignore us.\n\n#GunnConfessions9825"

- content: "9823. Idk if this is an unpopular opinion, but I feel like the superintendent doesn't actually know what is going on in our everyday communication with teachers. In his webinar he talked about how there \"no downsides to credit/ no credit\" which is just arrogant. I get that it could be worse, but there are so many students taking APs to boost their GPA that is now all for nothing.\n\nHe also thinks that we actually have zoom classes with our teachers other than office hours. The teachers take HOURS to respond to emails while we just get stuck and have no one answering our questions. Don't get me wrong, I love my teachers, but I think they do WAY less work than they would do during school pre closure... \n\nI just think the district should start paying attention to what actually goes on and not just what they hope to...\n\nSorry if you don't agree\n\n#GunnConfessions9823"

Like Payton says, you don’t know what they’re dealing with and a lot of them have children at home so they now have to deal with childcare AND posting everything for us which I imagine is quite a lot of work.\n\nAnd if you’re taking APs for the sole purpose of boosting your GPA then that’s your fault. Yeah the potential of raising it is a plus but I thought the point of taking them was cause u liked the subject so it shouldn’t matter"

It doesn’t sound like much but you’re literally just sitting in front of a computer all day with no interaction, it’s physically and mentally exhausting. You have these zoom calls that you all have to coordinate so by the end of the day you haven’t gone outside, you’ve barely talked to any of your family members and you make be mentally tired as hell, unless you were working on PE that day, you’ve gotten little to none physical activity, you can’t fall asleep because your body isn’t tired. Teachers are so inconsistent in where they post there info and need to be more clear about grading and assignments. I CANNOT DO 6 MORE WEEKS OF THIS\n\n#GunnConfessions9820"

- content: "9799. [2020] to 9777 - \nHi, I have struggled with eating disorders since I was 12.5, and I'm 18 now, so you can do the math... I hid my ED until I was 14, and even when my parents found out about it I wouldn't admit I had an eating disorder. You would think that after five and a half years I would get used to it, the struggle with food, starving myself and then binge eating, and the cycle repeats. When my parents found out I had an eating disorder, I was already anorexic. I couldn't leave the house for months, because even taking a walk might cause my heart to work too hard, and the danger of being anorexic is that your hurt will stop. I am so proud of you for admitting to yourself that you need help. I didn't tell my friends about my ED until this year, and except my parents and my siblings very few people in my family know. I was so, so ashamed. But I needed help. I still do. Get the help. Talk to your friends, to your parents. Not hiding the ED, not having to pretend like it's not hard for you to eat in public or try new food or even talking or thinking about it makes it a little easier to cope with, a little more manageable. When you struggle with an ED,  you need other people to help you. If there is a time to be selfish, it is now. It's your turn to think about yourself and your health. Don't undermine the power of an ED, and don't wait. I still meet a therapist and a doctor for eating disorders. They are both amazing and literally saved my life (well actually I had weekly meetings with both of them until quarantine...). If you want to talk with me, or want me to refer you to one of them or both of them, please let me know (you can comment here or post another gunn confession post :)) It can get better, so don't give up.\n\n#GunnConfessions9799"

I know that I’ll feel like crap if I don’t do anything in the day, so it makes me more determined to not have that feeling and instead, feel accomplished and driven to achieve my goals. It helps to make a list of things to do to stay on task and as for low energy, there are plenty of at home workouts to give you energy!"

For gods sake you're 14-18 you're not going to know everything 100%. keep going with an open mind, stop making ranks, be a kid. Do what you like, explore new things. Sure, feeling emotions are essential for growing as a person and becoming more compassionate. BUT when those emotions start to take over you as a person and you can't do anything you want anymore, its detrimental. Gunn gets it to that detrimental place. I feel for everyone. Resilience is key, and I hope that everyone can find it one way or another. This school is like no other... \n\n#GunnConfessions9774"

- content: "9740. @9732 \nI know legacy is kind of a sensitive topic, so if reading about it bothers you, I recommend skipping this post. \n\nI have legacy at two schools. My aunt also went to MIT, where legacy doesn't matter (and I didn't get in.) No shocker there.\n\nAt the first school, I didn't get in. That stung for a bit, but because it wasn't one of my top choices, it didn't bother me for too long.\n\nWith the second school, I'm sure legacy was considered in my application. My family has like 14 people who went there and donated a great deal in the school's early history. But I still think I would have gotten in on my own merits. Numbers-wise I was far above 75th percentile, and I wrote some pretty strong essays. I know having that degree of legacy is a gift, and one I'm very grateful for. But I'm happier with the school I chose (more intimate, more academically rigorous, great programs in my interests, less politically volatile, won't need to awkwardly laugh it off when they're like \"hey that building has your last name!\") So someone else has my spot now, maybe someone without the advantages I had.\n\n(If anyone knows who I am based on that description, please don't dox me. You can message me privately and ask about it, if you want.)\n\nThe way I see it, legacy is separate from how hard you work in school. Legacy just is - there's no reason to be proud of it or ashamed of it. If you have the skills to hack it at your intended college, then you deserve your spot. Because ultimately, it's less about who did the best on high school tests and got the most awards, and more about who will take the best advantage of their college experience. There's no way to predict the future. Admissions tries, but they do an imperfect job.\n\nI think if I had legacy at HYPSM (or other very competitive institutions) and got in, I'd have more mixed feelings, because those schools have such low admissions rates that qualified candidates get rejected for all sorts of bogus reasons. If legacy is the tipping point for your application, I could understand feelings of guilt. But the way I see it, getting in for a bogus reason is no worse than being rejected for bogus reasons. Rather than blame the student for something beyond their control, why not make it so that getting into the top 10-20 schools isn't seen as necessary for a good future? Why not emphasize a school's fit and unique programs over their prestige? Why not call it unhealthy when a parent expresses disappointment over their child not getting into a certain college, because they didn't game the system well enough?\n\nNot everyone who did well at Gunn is going to be filthy rich, powerful or famous. In fact, most people who go to top schools aren't any of those things. They're just normal people who were educated at places with a lot of history.\n\n[#GunnConfessions9732]\n\n#GunnConfessions9740"

And if they ask \"how'd you get my number,\" you have to have a non-creepy answer ready (if the real answer is creepy, I'd recommend against cold texting.) I would say to ask for their number in person, even though you already have it, but that's not possible right now. Maybe reach out over a less personal contact, like FB messenger or instagram."

- content: "9702. It’s so much harder to communicate my problems with someone right now. \nLike I love you, you’re one of my best friends, but I wish your self respect wasn’t so fragile that I can’t tell you the truth about why what you’re doing and how you act isn’t respectful or friendly. A lot of the time you make me feel worse about myself, but it’s never been harder than it is now to convey this to you without sounding like I’m rejecting responsibility; I recognize that how I react to you isn’t your problem and I don’t want to put that on you. But it doesn’t make any sense to me that you’d want to be my friend if you don’t respect me or our relationship. \n\nBut if our only method of communication is one where you feel so comfortable hanging up on me because you don’t agree with my opinions, then what the fuck do you want? I can’t talk to you honestly over zoom and genuinely have you understand me. I couldn’t tell you in person because three weeks ago, your quirks weren’t so obvious and annoying that they were ruining the moment, but they are now. I wish you weren’t so selfish. I don’t understand how you aren’t aware of how disrespectful you act. Seriously, it genuinely boggles me that you can treat our friends the way you do but turn around and cry on my shoulder if anyone comes close to treating you the same way. How can one person be so vain and un-self-aware, yer also incredibly self depricating to the point where you make the rest of your friends feel like shit?\n\nIt makes me so pissed seeing the way you treat our friends, these people I care about so much. It makes me more pissed that you seem to lack the common human decency of respect or composure. And maybe this rant blows my biggest disagreements with you out of proportion and doesn’t take into account how much I care about you, but you actually fucking exhaust me. It’d kill me to see you go to college and treat anyone new you meet in the same way. But I guess by then you’ll stop treating me like you’re my responsibility.\n\n#GunnConfessions9702"

    content: "You'll probably want to ask a psychologist about this, not a physiologist (unless you're curious about your organs.) But even more effective than a stranger psychologist would be a friend who's talked to you in person and texted you before. Like, \"Hey, what's my texting style? Does it seem more or less outgoing than in real life?\"\n\nA couple of common points about why people are shyer online, I'd say, would be:\n-Lack of spontaneity. You can't \"run into someone\" on the internet, so people who don't usually initiate conversations would do so even less online.\n-Being able to see your own words (and having them potentially on a platform forever) can make you more careful with them.\n-Lack of expression. Some people have very friendly tones of voice and body language, and when their conversation style is stripped down just to their words, it can seem reserved in contrast.\n-Lack of shared experiences. People often talk about things they did together, or while doing something together, or plan future hangouts together. Rehashing old memories on the internet gets old after a while, and simultaneous/future hangouts are impossible at the moment."

No longer having the ability to prove that will make it so they're not able to boost their college chances with this semester or demonstrate an \"upward trend.\""

- content: "9657. [2019] I’m a college student and there’s something important I need to tell all Gunn students.\n\nTHERE IS NO STATE MANDATE FOR THE SELF PROGRAM\n\nHow do I know this? I go to college in California, and 90% of the people I talk to who went to high school in California never heard of SELF before. The 10% who have are from the Bay Area, and most of them know it from one of their friends.\n\nThe admin is lying to you. They want to maintain their own power and pretend that they’re doing something to protect your mental health. This is to please the school board and superintendent which in turn pleases your parents into voting for the school board. So long as your parents are naïve enough to believe that SELF helps students, the power structure will not change. \n\nThe admin won’t admit they’re lying to you because if they do, they’ll be admitting a mistake on their part. Power hungry, authoritarian individuals never admit fault or mistakes. This is why the modern Chinese government still refuses to admit their role in the Great Chinese Famine. They don’t want the public to think that the communist party was ever at fault. \n\nIf you don’t believe that the admin is lying, you should personally demand for see a written order or piece of legislation from the governor, CA department of education, or California state legislature that directly orders the creation of SELF in schools. I dare you to do this. The admin won’t be able to find it because a statewide mandate doesn’t exist. In fact, you should be pushing for your school board representatives to do everything in their power to get to the bottom of this.\n\nI think SELF MIGHT be mandated by the school board, in which case the board could easily overturn their decision with enough pressure from the public. OR SELF is mandated by the admin in which case they can be easily replaced with enough opposition.\n\nI’m sick and tired of people lying and disrespecting high schoolers. Everyone thinks that you’re dumber than you actually are. It is absolutely insane to see the difference in respect adults have for me in college versus in high school. Our school’s president and academic senate stands up for the rights of students. Our president apologizes when he’s wrong and never lies to us. This is the kind of admirable leadership that we fought for through strikes, petitions, and votes. You guys seriously need to stand up and fight. People will not respect you until you do. Strike against SELF and demand transparency from the admin. \n\nAnd stop automatically assuming that whatever the admin says is the truth. You’re taught in science and history to critically think and analyze information, but once the admin says something, you automatically assume it’s true? Break out of this mindset. People in positions of power can and will lie. You need to call them out on their bullshit when it happens.\n\n#GunnConfessions9657"

    content: "I agree that SELF has not been implemented as effectively as it should have been, but they are required to do some variety of it. In 2018, CA’s Dep of Education released “California SEL Guiding Principles,” which pushes K-12 schools to implement SEL programs. Many districts have yet to implement such programs or have integrated it into pre-existing classes. Do we necessarily have to have it through SELF? No, but we do, in some way, have to have social emotional learning integrated in our district. I think it is unfair to say that they are completely lying to us, as they are attempting to balance the governments’ requests with our academic needs. As I said before, I in no way think SELF is perfect, but it is not going away. We need to collaborate to improve specific issues with the program, not sit around and complain about how the admin are all trying to screw us all over."

There's listeners (people who voluntarily talk to people who need to talk) and they can talk to you too. Personally I try to find things that make happy so hobbies help a lot like painting and doodling and also rollerblading. So that can help as well. Another thing is if you're really negative towards yourself you can change your perspectives on things and see the positives on you. Another thing is if you're really passionate in something like for example making films, painting or making music. You can use what you're going through as a driving force to make something creative."

They are expanding the campus and it's really nice and I was sad to go home (thanks corona). Most of the people who go to UCR are super down to earth and normal, and have been able to meet a bunch of people that aren't obsessed with being number one in everything -- it's actually very refreshing. If you decide to go it is a really great place to be able to experience what the lives of real people are like, not just people from Palo Alto. It's super diverse, both racially and economically, and you'll meet loads of people you never would have met going somewhere that is more prestigious by Gunn standards. I am personally of the opinion that many people view the school as less prestigious based on their own racial and economic biases. Please message me if you have any questions about what UCR is like because I really would like to encourage you to feel excited about this choice. And finally, damn, I forgot how toxic Gunn was..."

    content: "Oop, I decided to look at Gunn confessions after a million years. But here’s some advice:\nI would say when you looking into hyperpigmentation treatment from post-psoriasis, look into hyperpigmentation products that focus on anti-aging or for acne scars. (Those can come in sprays, serum, masks, gel or creams, and etc.)\nJust because they are the products that are for treating dark spots and scarring type of thing even when they aren’t totally the same thing. \nIn general, try to find some products that will work with you skin—> think about whether you should do creams/vitamin c or a serum/or something else. Read up the ingredients closely with over the counter treatments. Some ingredients will agitate you even more than before and you don’t even have to be allergic to the ingredients. \nHope this helps! Good luck and stay safe 🧡"

I’ll also be including other genres for anyone else interested :)\n\nFor the sake of non being repetitive, I’m not going to mention the big ones, like Black Clover, My Hero Academia, Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, Demon Slayer, etc. Those have probably been mentioned as some point or another.\n\nIf you want a summary of any of these anime, go to My Anime List and look them up.\n\nWith that being said, anime list!\n\nOverlord — this one’s kinda similar to One Punch Man in the sense that it’s a satire of OP characters. It also just generally has really interesting and unique characters.\nGenre: Action, Comedy, Isekai, Fantasy\n\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime — also has a diversity of characters and an OP main character. And his slime form is really cute.\nGenre: Action, Comedy, Fantasy, Isekai\n\nAssassination Classroom — less about action and a lot more about how classmates interact with each other and their teachers. Even still, Koro-Sensei is really OP and so is Nagisa to some extent.\nGenre: Comedy, Action, School\n\nAkatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn) — it’s an action... with a female lead! This one’s another one of my favorites, and I highly recommend watching this one.\nGenre: Historic, Adventure, Action\n\nNow some romance ones:\n\nLove is War — really cute. Highly recommend. Everyone is so loveable in this anime, even that one guy that’s gloomy all the time. It’s basically one giant satire of romance (pay attention to the narrator).\nGenre: Romance, School, Comedy\n\nYour Lie in April — a nice romance complete with music! Character development is really apparent and fun to see. Also the music is really good :P\nGenre: Music, Romance, School, Drama\n\nAcchi Kocchi — personally, I really love this one. Everyone is super cute, and there’s not much drama involved: it’s basically purely warm and fuzzy moments.\nGenre: Romance, Comedy, Slice of Life\n\nI’ll do some more later if more people want it haha.\n\n[#GunnConfessions9610]\n\n#GunnConfessions9621"

I definitely think that this sucks for people who had just worked themselves into a really good-looking place for the first quarter, but this corona would likely cause mass grade deflation. A lack of structured curriculum, test preparation, and varying circumstances with home life means that grades would be very unlikely to go up, but rather more likely to go down. Also, aren’t a couple of colleges also going to look past this semester? What do you all think?\n\n#GunnConfessions9611"

    content: "credit/no credit means that if you get a passing grade you get credit for the class, while if you don’t, you don’t get anything. your grade then, in most systems, has no effect on your gpa, no matter what. pass/fail usually doesn’t effect your gpa if you pass, but it usually does if you fail. it doesn’t necessarily mean a change in how these grades are determined – just one in how they’re counted – but it’s possible that both are changing. my college is doing a similar thing and we were also confused but luckily a professor sent out a message where she sorted it out (which is what i’m basing this on)"

He recently made out with another girl, and told the exact same people that he refused to let me tell for fear of it being \"leaked.\" He's pursuing a relationship with her, and everyone is allowed to know. And it makes me feel like shit because not only am I no longer good enough for him, she's so much more enough that he's okay letting everyone know about her and not me.

He took advantage of your kindness, and it's a good thing for you that he is no longer able to. Sometimes, it's impossible to fully understand someone's perspective or have a conversation with people like that, and you just need to find a way to move on to someone who does deserve you. And yes, it will hurt, but at the end of the day you'll be so much happier alone than with someone toxic who never loved you the way you deserve to be loved."

Parents really need to lay off a little bit and let the board work, cause right now the board can’t do anything"

- content: "9574. @9556, i’m the person who posted the og post and, lemme tell you, if your looking for preventative measures you shouldn’t be looking to trump and america for an example because he sure did not do anything except pretend that it was going away for nearly 3 weeks before even recognizing it as an actual problem that he should be dealing with instead of trying to silence it. he actually told people that it was ok go to work even if they were sick, and that the virus was completely contained even tho that was NOWHERE near true. Now i’m not saying that China did everything right, of course not, they also covered things up and ignored the problem at the beginnng. However, they did eventually pull it together and built 16 hospitals to treat people, the last of which just closed because they’ve actually CONTAINED THE VIRUS. Look at South Korea, they’ve got a less than 1% mortality rate because they took full preventative measures. So don’t come lecturing me that I need to “toughen up” or whatever the fuck because what definitely doesn’t help an issue like this is people blaming a literal natural occurrence of a virus on an entire race of people. there have been a significant increase of hate crimes against asian people since the virus began, and it’s not a coincidence. Yes, a lot of Chinese in the area support trump. that doesn’t negate the people who have been unfairly discriminated against and hurt because of the ignorant, racist people who can’t understand that they shouldn’t be blaming people, they should just shut up and stay inside so it stops spreading. So I’m sorry you are having a hard time facing the facts, but there it is. Racists are using this as an excuse to inact their prejudice against people who have done nothing wrong.\n\n[#GunnConfessions9556]\n\n#GunnConfessions9574"

- content: "9573. [2020] A few weeks ago, before quarantine, I was really considering killing myself if school got canceled. (I won’t) But I just never actually thought we’d get here. As someone who uses school as a distraction from my home life, this isn’t just about me missing out on prom or seeing Romeo and Juliet or possibly graduating, but trust me I feel each of those losses too. It’s about every mental aspect of school; having a purpose to my day is so incredibly important. Having a reason to get ready in the morning, to like how I look. Seeing people in classes I wouldn’t necessarily call my friend, but I could make a silly joke to every now and then, that’s gone. I want to be learning. But I’ve barely had the intrinsic motivation to live the past few years, much less do flexible online learning.\n\nOutside of that, I could and have called my friends, but I know both that my mood won’t do them any good, and that I wouldn’t want to see them being productive if it meant leaving me in the dust. That’s an incredibly selfish way to put that and I wish I could change it. But. Also, what would we talk about besides what’s happening in the world right now? Every moment I’m awake, I spend thinking about how next I’m going to get food to feed my family, how we’ll stretch the money I’m not making right now, how to make my mom see the sunlight for once, have some light exposure therapy. How I can’t tell anyone because my problems don’t compare to the fact that they’re “missing prom.” I’m living day to day. And I don’t really need the advice of my friends, lovely as they are, sitting in their kushy homes, complaining about everything that got taken away from them.\n\nThis week I got accepted to my top school. I haven’t told anyone. I’m immunocompromised and I completely understand the value of flattening the curve. But I’m in a valley. A violent drop from the content, king-of-the-hill living that was the beginning of my senior year. And I can’t fucking wait for it to go back up.\n\n#GunnConfessions9573"

You've worked hard for it. I hope you find that life has a purpose beyond working toward the next milestone. Relaxing, enjoying the sunrise, pursuing hobbies - those things can add meaning to your life, too. Plus, there are ways to be productive and gain a sense of achievement on one's own. How? I'm not sure. I only know what's worked for me, and I don't have much confidence that it would work the same way for anyone else.\n\nI hope you stay safe, healthy, and that you find something that drives you.\n"

    content: "Trump response timeline. (I didn't write this btw)\n\nJanuary 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”\n\nFebruary 2: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”\n\nFebruary 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”\n\nFebruary 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”\n\nFebruary 25: “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”\n\nFebruary 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”\n\nFebruary 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”\n\nFebruary 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”\n\nFebruary 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”\n\nFebruary 28: “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa.” “They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.”\n\nMarch 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”\n\nMarch 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”\n\nMarch 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”\n\nMarch 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”\n\nMarch 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”\n\nMarch 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”\n\nMarch 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”\n\nMarch 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”\n\nMarch 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”\n\nMarch 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”\n\nMarch 9: “This blindsided the world.”\n\nMarch 9: \"The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant.”\n\nMarch 10: \"It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\"\n\nMarch 13: National Emergency Declaration\n\nMarch 13: “I don't take responsibility at all”\n\nMarch 15: \"TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\"\n\nMarch 16: \"I give myself a 10 out of 10\"\n\nMarch 17: \"I've always known this is a real--this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\""

Of course either chem or chem h will be great, but if you’re in a class with other kids who signed up for a challenge, I think that’ll help motivate u to really grow in the class.  Just don’t feed off of any toxicity, like when your classmates stay up until 2am to finish a lab!  Don’t be “the friend” 😉 (you’ll get that one later)"

And They are all in this one campus together. people touch the desks, Calc etc..... Think of if ONE person got it. Think of how many people would be exposed to it possibly. Friends, teachers, Whoever was using their desk throughout the day, if they barrowed a calc, whoevers using that throughout the day. I dont know, it just doesnt seem that. Sanitary? I know people and teachers are taking pre coutions. but still. And the Possiblity of someone getting the corona here isnt that far off fyi.\n\n#GunnConfessions9470"

It’s just a matter of time before it blows up. Stop it now before it becomes uncontrollable. So what if we have to go to school for a few weeks in the summer in the grand scheme of things health is more important and everyone has to make sacrifices sometimes. The problem with this school is that many people are stuck in a bubble and don’t know how to react and be flexible to real world problems. Sometimes shitty situations occur at inconvenient times. There I said it. Here’s an article that explains the numbers. https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca\n\n#GunnConfessions9467"

It's not something I have ever really thought about, but one of my teachers today said that there are some people in this district who don't have homes. I don't know the statistics, and so it is fair to say it might not be the biggest reason, but they are still students in PAUSD regardless. I don't think the main reason is that teachers are lazy though. Some might be, but a lot I have seen already alter schedules and homeworks right after they got the updates, just in case we have to stay home. "

- content: "9393. [2021] PLEASE READ. This is not a confession, but I really hope this gets posted as I think this is a really serious and f*cked up issue. As the corona virus case increases, the number of racist actions towards Asians are increasing as well. I saw too many videos of asians just getting humiliated in public, people shouting racial slurs to asians, and committing violence to them. I have experienced quite similar stuff in the local grocery store and I feel absolutely disgusted and horrible. It made me sick. Please. Share this issue with a lot of people and the mainstream media is not doing a good job of covering this issue. We can at least discuss about it and make it more prominent. I really hope no one, not only Asians, get humiliated like this. I’m sorry if this post was mostly about racism against Asians, but this corona virus panic and using those “fear” justification is becoming insane. The number of attempted violence and public harassment is increasing by days and it is extremely sad to see that not many people are aware of this or even considering the fact that there are people out there being treated like trash. It is absolutely upsetting. I really wanted to address this issue as I want this to stop occurring. Thank you for reading this long post and I really hope you check out this link: https://twitter.com/KALONSMERALDO/status/1235429090745896960?s=20\n\n^warning: It contains violence. If this triggers you, please don’t see. But I really hope many people take a look. \n\n#GunnConfessions9393"

[2020] Unpopular opinion: people are against homosexuality because of their religion should not be attacked.\n\nImagine this:\nYou identify with a certain religion, which may have a holy book. You align your moral code with this book, read it constantly, live by it. You put your faith in this religion, the community that has supported you for years, and this sacred book. Faced with the most difficult decisions, the most difficult topics, you turn to religion to guide you. And is LGBTQ+ a [~~relatively~~] new topic? Yes. So you listen to your religious leaders, meditate over this book.\n\nI guess I'm trying to say that if you put 100% of your faith into a religion, would you choose unconditional acceptance or your religion? If you choose unconditional acceptance, then did you really put all of your faith into this religion? But if you choose your religion, then what happens to unconditional acceptance?\n\nI am not at all saying that it is okay to use religion as an excuse to be prejudiced or to discriminate. I am saying that if any of us were religious people, perhaps our choice to accept homosexuality is at odds with our choice to follow our religion--a very difficult choice indeed.\n\nWould love to hear opposing arguments.\n\n#GunnConfessions9391"

That leaves the locker room with 1 stall. We also have like 1 soap dispenser and it doesn't always work. There's a wall that just a piece of plywood instead of drywall. There are also clowns who will spray thier entire can of axe in one go. This is pretty much a given, but there's also piss on the floor.

Biden has long represented the Democratic establishment and that establishment has shifted left with the emergence of Bernie's progressive wing.

    content: "A bit late but the real danger of people our age contracting the coronavirus is not the threat of us potentially dying, but passing it off to other people who may be more vulnerable to its adverse effects, particularly the elderly and individuals who suffer from some form of immunodeficiency. We make almost perfect carriers as our immune systems will make the virus seem more like a cold or perhaps make it so that we exhibit no symptoms at all; all the while we are still capable of spreading the infection.\n\nAs someone who has parents over 50 years old and grandparents who are over 70 living in the same house, I am very much concerned of catching it and spreading it to them as the mortality rate for their age demographic is around 10-14%. So please don’t be quick the shrug off the threat that the coronavirus poses; it may not majorly affect your life, but it very well could affect the lives of those around you."

    content: "(On the basis of Christianity): Remember that no matter whether you believe being gay to be a sin or not, the point of the Gospel is that we are all offered salvation despite our sin. Your father using hell to threaten gay people is imo pretty hypocritical. There is a huge range of opinion you could take about whether being gay is a sin. I would encourage you to look at both sides. At the end of the day, however, God loves you and that’s what’s important to remember."

    content: "Adding onto Annie Leonard, hotlines are often for specific, sometimes dire, situations. what’s wrong with allowing queer people to talk in public and *mention that they’re queer*? do you see even the expression of deviation from the norm as so threatening that you need to box it off onto a hotline? are you suggesting open queerness is only okay during an emergency?"

    content: "Did a quick search on how many times the words \"gay\", \"bi\" and \"trans\" are included in all the Gunn confessions (not including this one.) It's about 97 times. Considering there's currently 9373 confessions, I think you'll survive.\n\nAlso, it's great that hotlines exist. But it's still talking to a stranger. Many LGBTQ+ youth don't have people they know who they feel they can talk to about these things. Imagine if you had something really important in your life and could only talk about it with strangers on the phone."

    content: "I hear you. It's the whole \"whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer /\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, /\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles /\nAnd by opposing end them\" question. \n\nI guess the best argument I have is: think of the worst thing that's ever happened to you. Or time you felt worst between the ages of 0-5. Do you wish you'd stopped existing before then so you could avoid that event, even though it means you wouldn't have any of the positive experiences that occurred afterward? Today, that event probably isn't as big a deal. Sure, it might still hurt, but it doesn't feel devastating like it once did, or you wouldn't be able to function.\n\nIf you're going through a cruddy period, it's easy to imagine that things will never improve. But prior evidence in the form of life experiences tend to suggest otherwise.\n\nIdk feel free to submit a confession again if you disagree and I'll find something else to say."

    content: "Last time I checked, Sanders' FDR style programs brought the country out of the Great Depression, built much of our modern infrastructure, and led to a booming economy that can provide decent-paying jobs to all Americans. To fearmonger about \"higher taxes\" is the oldest trick in the book to oppose very commonsense policies like guaranteeing healthcare to all Americans and providing them a living wage."

    content: "OK. You asked for advice. So as an adult who has been through a lot in life, perhaps I could be of some help here... \n\nI have come to realize, increasingly, that doing the right thing is one of the most important things in life. When you focus on doing what is best (for you, someone else, the planet, the situation, etc), it is hard to be manipulated. The key is knowing what is right/best. If you don't know, perhaps it is worth taking the time to figure it out. But once you know you are on the right path, it's hard for someone else to control/use you. \n\nHope this helps at least a little."

- content: "9248. [2020] @4238 Thought this should be posted again for the Juniors since caaspp testing is coming up soon \n\nRegarding the CAASPP:\nAlmost all mentioned positives are either lies or half-truths.\n\nFunding: Gunn does not qualify nor has ever qualified for Title I funding, the only funding affected by standardized testing participation as implemented by No Child Left Behind and the succeeding ESSA (>35% low income students). The district encouraging students to take the CAASPP is due to pressuring from the state Education Department since there is a chance that a state would lose federal funding for poor schools receiving Title I funding if they drop below 95% statewide participation. However, plenty of states have dropped to even as low as 80% and none have ever lost federal funds. There is state money associated with participation that may only be spent to negate the cost of the CAASPP. The SAO shutting down in the morning was based on divergence of funds for other purposes (Title IX oopsie) as evidenced by the PAUSD budget sheet for 2019.\n\nSchool Rating:\nAs mentioned before, Gunn already has a very high score based on CAASPP results even from years with low participation. Interestingly, the year participation grew from 25% to 65%, test scores dropped from an average 97.91 to 94.8.\n\nAccreditation:\nThere is no evidence to suggest that a high school has ever been unaccredited solely because of low state testing participation.\n\nCollege:\nCAASPP results only allow you to avoid work for California State Universities (CSU's, NOT UC's) introductory courses, most of which can be skipped by senior or junior classes at Gunn.\n\nCAASPP scores do not affect the admission process for either CSU's or UC'S, only the aforementioned skipping introductory courses for CSU's. The state did propose adding scores to admission for UC's in 2018 but the UC board of regents concluded that CAASPP scores have no correlation with student merit and would take 5-6 years to study and come to a decision.\n\nAlmost all colleges do not look at the Seal of Biliteracy or the Golden State Seal of Honor as other states do not have equivalents.\n\nRaffle: Ok this one is valid but beware since some seniors have reported not receiving their prizes from last year.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's your own prerogative whether you want to spend 8 hours for the CAASPP, but just be aware of the costs and benefits of your choice.\n\n#GunnConfessions9248"

    content: "TLDR my family’s been abusive for years (like most Indian families) and I have PTSD, I’m still scared of my brother. When my brother left, I started getting aggressive and hitting back. Then my housemate named Leslie came in, she told my Mom how to parent, what to do, and didn’t let her parent. Like for a punishment, she would tell my Mom “oh that’s not good enough, she’s never going to learn her lesson” and that sort of thing. Basically bc I hit back, Leslie called the cops and they came a couple times. I got arrested for battery. The recent time I went back, it was for hitting Leslie when she hit me first. I was trying to get my stuff back from her room and I was willing to cooperate with the police. I told them what happened, how I just wanted my stuff back and how it was justified but I might have been on her property (the cops thought I was) and I got arrested for battery again. Leslie bringing the police into problems which don’t need the police, me trusting the police but they end up arresting me is why I now don’t trust the police and why I stay the fuck away from cops now. Leslie also left when I got back. I don’t want to see her again bc I went through so much shit bc of her. Yeah, it definitely was my fault for hitting back but, at the same time, I don’t think police should be called"

    content: "I went in technically as an \"intended physics major\" because that was easier to rattle off than say \"well I'm undecided but I love A, B and C...\" \n\nCollege is great! It's so much easier to decide whether a subject is something I could focus on all four years when I'm not taking 7-8 classes at a time like in high school. There's more time to really delve into the content and see if you like it. As is, I've narrowed down my potential majors to two, and I still have 4 more academic terms to decide (~2.5 semesters for you non-trimester folks.)\n\nSome people find being undecided kind of paralyzing. I'm one of them, and making a list of the potential options and mapping out how the requirements would fit into the next few years really helped me. That being said, others find freedom in not committing to one thing.\n\nAnd even the people who do go in with a super strong idea of their major/career path generally encounter unexpected twists and turns along the way. Knowing what you want to major in in advance can save time and be reassuring, but you might lose out on some soul-searching later (\"maybe I really *can* be a journalist\" stuff.)\n\nPS: A lot of people narrow down majors with \"am I a humanities person or a STEM person?\" Since my primary academic interests are music, theatre, physics, psychology and Chinese with occasional forays into philosophy/chemistry, this was not a great place for me to start. If you like everything, you're not alone."

    content: "Tldr; just take it.\n\nDon’t think about CAASPP as a means for funding as much as it is crucial for: \n1) obtaining data for critical decisions the Board makes on areas of weakness in teaching (esp. for historically underrepresented minorities/socioeconomically disadvantaged students). \n2. Compliance/ranking of school. In the past, if you don’t take it, district gets an equivalent of an “n/a” for the student. Starting this year, if a student doesn’t take it, the district gets assigned the minimum score for the student. All of this is to say it will make the district look very bad. Then we run into compliance issues.\n3. Taking the CAASPP test is one of the prerequisites for being college/career ready in the state’s eye (which is important if you are applying to CSUs). \n4. PAUSD tops the chart on only one thing in the state: lowest participation in CAASPP testing. Opting out is literally not the norm in any other district but Palo Alto. \n\nThat’s my spiel. "

I don't think I was a slacker in high school, but I've been more motivated to learn + challenge myself in college. Burnout is real no matter what kind of environment you're in; the key is learning to prioritise yourself and your well-being.\nCollege is a fun time tho; would recommend :)"

    content: "Psych major/bio minor has been easier than my senior year. I had 3 APs one honors. College has been much easier for me for a number of reasons the first being that my parents arent riding my ass like a fucking rodeo show. The second being that there is a better balance for me between class time vs at home work time. The third for me is that I really struggled with work ethic in high school and going to college gave me some kind of mental kick in the ass that’s gotten me better with my work. It’s frankly different for every person I’ve met though so dont take my word as gold."

Now it wasn’t super loud, but it was very distracting, and I mean it’s a public place right? So I said, politely, and this is a quote of what I said, “Excuse me, sir, would you mind turning the music down?” And first he said “I’m deaf, if you don’t like it, you leave. Leave.” This was said super rudely. I guess this is where I could have reacted by saying something like “sorry”, and turned away. But I was very confused by the tone of this man, and kinda dumbstruck. Then he started yelling, “Do you have ID? Let me see ID”. And “I’m the master here”. And he kept shouting those two things. And then the entire coffee shop was looking, and people tried to intervene but that somehow made it worse. I don’t know. Tell me that he would have still felt like he could yell at me if I weren’t a young woman. I get that, unlike last time, this isn’t a big deal, and that this might not even be related to gender, but oh my god all I want to do is sit in a coffee shop and work is that too much to ask for??\n\n#GunnConfessions9105"

I know it’s fake because the instant I put my AirPods in, he either stops talking or gets louder. And this time, he didn’t even bother with a phone, he just started speaking. Why are people such dicks? I mean it only took me three minutes to drive to another Starbucks, but STILL. Unacceptable.\n\n#GunnConfessions9073"

    content: "Women do tend to outlive men, but it's probably mostly due to biological factors and not social ones (especially since this age gap exists in less \"developed\" societies where there aren't prisons, there's less suicide, etc.) I'm not saying there aren't social factors that contribute to men having shorter lifespans on average, but there's also no way of proving it. Heart disease can't be equalized.\n\nSorry.\n\nFun fact, there is evidence that for men, one alcoholic drink per day can very slightly decrease risk of heart disease. More than one greatly INCREASES risk of heart disease though. Most studies I've read on this effect say it doesn't exist for women; drinking regularly at all increases their risk.\n\nOther things you can do to increase your lifespan (regardless of sex):\n-Eat well, preferably 2-4 meals per day depending on size\n-Avoid copious amounts of sugar or oxidizing oils\n-Exercise at least a little bit as many times per week as possible\n-Get enough sleep\n-Get treatment for serious illnesses, physical ailments or mental disorders\n-Do what you can to reduce stress and spend some time out and about with people\n\nhttps://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-1/15-24.pdf\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTdHw-yi6ACXJhaLk3Q2Mi7RCkIYn6P4GLmTtwkh1g6gr_nE8bQNceWFRbYetv3E9nINZw8BH5hxpyb/pubhtml (simple spreadsheet I made of life expectancy by country/sex.)"

If you want to get more of me, lobby to bring me in to teach self-defense at your school. If you know any juniors at Paly, ask them how it their self-defense program went with me a couple years ago, when they were in 9th. I think we had a blast. And they learned some valuable skills. I am a teacher by profession and have taught Karate and self-defense to many thousands of students in this area and look forward to teaching many thousands more (I have many present Karate students at Gunn). But I also enjoy mentoring students in how to be kind and considerate, how to find joy in life and what to look forward to in the future. I'm working to start a mentoring program for PA students. If you haven't already done so, please complete this short survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3YQFBKV\n\nAnd yes, I always wear a helmet when I bike. All the cool people do. ;-)"

When you listen to the people who want you to change, you are giving in to the hate and judgements that they are putting onto to you because they think they know better. They judge what they see instead of judging what they know. However, you have your own body, mind, and spirit that says otherwise. Be the person you truly want to be if it really makes you happy and understand that changing yourself is pointless unless you really want to change for your own benefit, not someone else’s.

- content: "9044. [Important Message for Valentine’s Day ] This is super controversial and people are likely gonna be super mad at me for saying this but I feel like it needs to be said.\n\nWith Valentine’s Day coming up some of you need to stop being so thirsty. You don’t need a relationship to be happy and thinking that you do will make you more depressed. A lot of people get into relationships when they’re not socially, emotionally, or physically ready for one and it will hurt them in the long run.\n\nIf you’re attractive (if someone has confessed feelings for you ever in your life you’re attractive) or even an average looking girl then it may be easy for you to find someone on Valentine’s Day. Just because you could be in a relationship doesn’t mean that you should. You might not be socially or emotionally mature enough for one, and it might make sense to wait even if you don’t want to at this moment. I’ve seen so many friends and classmates go through terrible relationships because they were incompatible but both very attractive. I’ve seen friends who date or fuck in an attempt to remove some form of trauma. You need to learn that dating isn’t going to solve your emotional or social problems. Being in a romantic or sexual relationship won’t necessarily make you happier in the long run, and if you’re not mature enough it could actually make you very depressed when you get dumped or have to break up with someone. Other people can help, but only you can make yourself happy. \n\nIf you’re ugly, you need the face that reality and understand that life isn’t fair. People can and do judge you based on your looks first and your personality second. You can’t control your race, the size of certain body parts, or your height. You can’t change society’s perception or expectations of beauty. You can’t expect someone else to like you. You do not “deserve” romantic love. And you might never find love, but you can still find happiness. Learn to take care of yourself and be happy with who you are. Find out what you like to do and go do it. Figure out what your personality is and how you want to live your life. This will make you happy with who you are, and it’ll give you a way to be happy while you’re alone. Once you actually have a personality, find people who have similar personalities, hobbies, and interests. Spend time with them and make new friends. Only when you reach this stage will you be socially and emotionally ready for a relationship. Granted, society is fucked up and you might not ever get a chance, but suck it up buttercup, life isn’t fair. You can still be happy with your friends and hobbies which is why it’s so important for you to learn to be happy alone and with friends before even trying to get into a relationship.\n\nIf you’re struggling alone right now and you feel ugly and unwanted, I get it. I’ve been there. I know you might desperately want a relationship. But the solution isn’t trying to run when you haven’t even learned to crawl. \n\nIt took me a long time to understand this but now that I do I’m much happier with my life. No I’m still not dating anyone, but I am very content with myself and my friends now. And I think that’s far more important than any potential relationship I’ll ever be in.\n\n#GunnConfessions9044"

Also, the prequels actually GOT BETTER WITH EACH NEW MOVIE, which is the exact opposite of how the last trilogy went...\n\n#GunnConfessions9043"

I realized growing up in an unbelievably privileged bubble like Palo Alto creates some weird and unwelcome comfort in saying the n word. There are many many non poc who don’t say it but there are also way too many that do. All of my guy friends say it when I continually ask them not to. And when they realized it upset me they turned to saying when I wasn’t there. I really wish people would recognize that non people of color saying the n word is racist. “It was so racist that they gave Tyler the Creator an award for Urban rap when that wasn’t even the genre” stop being fake woke and saying this shit when I know you call your white friends the n word.\n\n#GunnConfessions9042"

I didn't want to post it because it made me feel so disgusted, but I still wanted to speak out on it. You have no right to make those comments about my body, to objectify me in such a vulgar manner. You have no right to speak about me like that; focusing on my physical appearance instead of my personality. My boyfriend is lucky to have me because of who I am, not how I look. Females are still being described of as their physical appearance when they are so much more. \nYour confessions made me feel so violated and disgusted with myself. I felt watched and considering it's Sunday when you wrote that, I know it wasn't because you had just seen me at school. I hope you know how horrible you made me feel and how frustrating it is as a female to have to still deal with this. Please change your behavior, stop objectifying women, and never look at me again, thanks.\n\n#GunnConfessions9036"

As well as this, happiness is very much temporary. Even when we have accomplished something, we will always desire more, as there is no point for us to stop. On the other hand, if I don't do stuff and am not productive, I get anxious or depressed. I feel like life is innately miserable, or at best mediocre.\n\n#GunnConfessions9032"

We're evolutionarily designed not to bum around for too long, because if we do we get bummed out.\n\nInstead of thinking of the grand scheme of things (except for things you're really excited about - like \"wow I might get to travel to x one day\" or \"wow I might get to try snowmobiling someday\"), I think the easiest way to be happy is to get lost in a steady but reasonable stream of productivity. Spikes of work followed by flatlining is generally less pleasant."

I've written a letter to Cathy Lawrence already, but I just wanted to spread the word about what you can do to hopefully fix this. If you look at page 56 of the student handbook (link: https://gunn.pausd.org/sites/default/files/gunn_handbook_19-20.pdf), Gunn has endorsed the \"InsideOut\" Initiative regarding sports on campus. \n\nAmong other things, the initiative states that \"The program emphasizes a transformational relationship between coaches and athletes rather than\na 'win at all costs' transactional relationship.\"\n\nAfter seeing the emails and hearing the complaints myself, it is clear that Coach Granville is in violation of this initiative. If you really want to get involved, spread the word, and tell your friends and your parents (admin will do something if parents get involved!) to email admin about your concerns. Good luck guys, track was one of my favorite parts ab Gunn and it sucks to see this happen.\n\nSincerely,\na pissed off alumni\n\n#GunnConfessions9010"

How does he expect us to improve if he doesn’t let us practice. He also yells at students who are injured for missing practice (going to the trainer instead of getting more injured), and had lost his temper in front of students when yelling at Curtis multiple times.

[2021] You can bet I've never experienced racism, but surely you can understand that to somebody who was born way after slavery was abolished, all I work with is what I experience, and what I experience is the media and apparently you saying meh, racism against white people is moderately okay because those poor black people (#emotional) suffered so much and still suffer sometimes today. I don't find it fair that I am associated to ill intent because of something that happened 155 years ago, way before I was born, because of the color of my skin. I am not responsible for what happened back then, and the law has COMPLETLY fixed this. Don't give me that bullshit that \"yeah but the feeling still lingers and you wouldn't understand if you were black\", because that's a problem with a select few people being assholes, not a systematic problem. The only time when that lingering toxicity excuse would have been relevant would be ~60 years ago when some people who owned slaves might still have been alive. Black people have the exact same rights as white people, and the liberal media likes to focus on the cases when a black person was oppressed modern day at the hands of an unlawful officer or something like that when the fact of the matter is that that officer does not represent the white race, and it does not happen as often as the liberals make you want to think.\nI am fully aware that what happened 155 years ago and the cases of racism that still occur today are terrible, but it was the individual who was racist, not the race. Your mindset now is the exact same reason some people today associate black people with crime and drugs, because some large cases happened to have a black person involved, and the stupid human race likes to generalize and say oh that guy represents the whole race. This. mindset. is. fucking. racist! (and it goes both ways!)\nI am not saying racism isn't a problem still today, but it isn't because of slavery or history, its because some people are just assholes, and that happens all the time and is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things"

Why do we have to take the blame for not being respected? We’ve communicated to Granville several times that we don’t like the way he is treating us, but he chose to ignore our concerns and continue to abuse us. This is not just about his bad coaching but is more about who he is as a person. XC and Track should be a community where everyone feels respected and safe. With that being said, maybe check your reality and realize that you were fortunate enough to not have experienced an emotionally abuse by a coach whom you trusted and that you are being disrespectful towards athletes who have been crying for help to even be treated as decent human beings."

    content: "Yeah! My friends in college have more similar personalities and hobbies compared to my friends in high school. Don’t get me wrong my friends in high school were great, but a lot of the time they were uninterested in government, politics, and other things I wanted to talk about. My college friends now find what I have say much more interesting. \n\nGunn is a small place with a lot of people who are similar. If you go to a big university you’re bound to make friends who you can relate to more."

Despite multiple cries for help from the team, the admins have not even attempted to address the deteriorating mental health of track and xc athletes. After dozens of meetings with the principle and assistant principals, very few changes or even reassurances have been made. It’s a real reality check when you realize the people who are supposed to care about you don’t actually give a f*ck as long as you don’t actually kill yourself."

I used to be able to actually talk about things and joke around with my coaches, but now I just try to avoid him as much as possible because I always feel ashamed."

- content: "8987. [replying to 8966]\n\"at a minimum a shirt or sports bra must be worn\" \nMichael Granville, 2020 January 30 \nY'all still have plenty of time to show off your abs. Additionally, the email never specified which part of your body needs to be covered by the bra. So you can show off your nipples too if you wear the bra on your head or arm or something. \n\n[8966. [Gunn T&F] Last track season I had one of the best times of my life being able to compete in ccs as a sophomore was awesome all the pressure and adrenaline rush was great. Its only been 3 days into the new season. The numbers of sprinters we has dropped. We have no varsity girl sprinters and Im fairly sure we just lost the last two varsity boys sprinters. One being the most dedicated man I have ever known. He's willing to train 7 hours just to get a good practice in. Which is far beyond what CCS regulation allows. Most of the OG sprinters left for hurdles or jumps and its all cause of Granville. I dont think anyone else who wasn’t in track/xc will ever be able to understand what’s happening hence why the admin hasn't done anything. More than half the varsity time have complained about him and his training methods. Im already injured and its because of his over training. I was hoping for an even better season sub 50 in the 400 and go to states in the 4x4, but thats gone. I dont really have anything else besides track. But Im willing to quit entirely or just join paly or lahs track. Anything to get me a good season. Ive tried multiple times to get Granville to lessen the workouts. He's been over training our fast twitch muscles (muscles used for sprinting) which has caused great fatigue to set in. We had to run a 500x2 (1 1/4 lap) at 65 seconds per. This doesn't seem like anything but anyone who’s reading this can’t go sub 75. After we ran that, we were supposed to do these weird walking lunge drills and wickets (running over small hurdles to better your form). Then we had to do 3 point stands which no one could do and then we did normal block starts. Leaving just me to teach people how to properly start. Im notorious for having the worst start ever. But Granville being the “GOAT” left me to help people. He instead did some random sign in thing that we have to do. Which would bring me to the new rules. We have to sign in and out which uses up 30 minutes just to sign in and then another 30 to sign out. So an hour in total to make sure people come. We have to warm up on the field which is where throws happen to practice and Im not sure when but I know someone will be hit by a discus someday which could potentially kill them cause thats what happens when a 3lbs disc is flying at 20+mph slams into your head. We also have a rule where if you can come to 4/5 of the practices you basically just shouldn't come. My friend he has to miss a few days a week but is willing to make them up over the weekend taking No one else's but his time to run. But of course Granville says he should just quit. Mind you he’s been running track since middle school. A little fun stupid rule we have is we can’t run with our shirts off (guys) or in sports bras (girls). Which is so incredibly stupid cause when it hits 80 degrees + and we just ran our arses off and have a few more reps to go those shirts are going off. Its also just a runners pride thing to do build up a sweat enough to get those runners abs to glisten and then show off to the world. The last thing would be captains. Granville threatened the upper class men by saying “captain positions, are available for anyone who appears to be a leader, this could mean a freshmen could be a captain.” Some of y'all will probably be well just step up then. Heres the thing if we do then we suck up to Granville boosting his already peaked in high school “GOAT” ego but on the plus we get to be captain. Or we could do nothing have a freshmen who doesn’t understand anything be a captain. The complete final rule was to not question his training styles/methods or anything in general. Even though we already have injured team mates, terrible workouts and horrible communication throughout the team. This may not seem strict but the track team is built on preppies (people who do it for the prep) and w/o them, we pretty much have no team. I’m just kinda done with track now so I guess I quit.]"

A lot of these students need an outlet and used to see their sport as a safe haven.  Some of them are describing their coach as abusive and their administration as negligent and somehow the athletes are at fault. What an absurd notion.  There is a huge power imbalance in play and these dismissive types of responses help demonstrate a part of Gunn’s poor mental health climate.\n\nI would expect so much better from people who have gone through that environment.  The empathy-devoid response of “suck it up, we’ve all been through it” puts you in the same level as those boomers who tell young people to get jobs, get married and own a home by 30 — you’re out of touch.  Students need supportive communities and safe havens and it looks like several of them are at jeopardy."

- content: "8983. [Former XC and Track Member] I'm honestly just so disappointed in Coach Granville. I really thought he had potential with his big personality and high school track experience. He made me not like running. He took the joy out of it. The XC captains put their reputation and even college opportunities on the line to try to help and fix the team and when Granville would have none of it, they got admin involved. People were crying, too afraid to confront him but too injured to do his unreasonable and unfitting workouts. The captains planned an entire team trip and I was shocked and disappointed to learned he canceled it due to fake reasons he made up because his ego was hurt and he was upset at them for even questioning his authority. Track and XC gave me so much joy and allowed me to reduce my stress in high school. Due to Granville, I no longer had that outlet and had worse mental health due to this situation. To you outsiders, this may seem like a bunch of pointless drama, but it has been horrible. Admin has been involved and did nothing. The Oracle wrote an article...nothing. Parents got involved...nothing. Coaches got involved and they got fired. What can we do. Please help us."

Cause some people have their heads so far up their asses that they can’t see what’s wrong. Don’t even try to make the argument that his intentions are good. Someone could say that Hitler’s intentions were good. BUT were they morally right? No so shut the fuck up if you’re not in track/cross country\n\n[8949. [Gunn TF] Fuck the new track rules. Why do they even apply to juniors and seniors. How the fuck do they expect me to show up 4 times a week minimum during my junior year. That’s literally my busiest year. Unlike sophomore and freshmen year, there’s no incentive to do track. It’s not like my whole life is just track I got other shit to do. The head coach is such a clown making the most bullshit set of rules I have ever seen. At this point they might as well kick me from the team cause I’m not putting up with a freshmen being captain or any of that bullshit.]"

Gunn track coaches are incapable of working with anyone that isn’t completely subservient in every way, a significant problem, considering any functioning track program in history has required assistant coaches. And so, it can perhaps be understandable that from a helpless student's perspective, Gunn administrators, and ESPECIALLY the Gunn sports administration, seem to care more about the face of the school and maintaining normalcy then the well-being of their students. It is positively disgraceful that a front-page article about coaching issues was published, with not only nothing to be done from it, but that the coaches only response was to talk about the athletes performance. We are HUMAN BEINGS, Not TROPHIES! I have seen athletes crying, unable to sleep and in severe emotional distress, not to speak of the effect it's had on the academic performance and livelihood of some because of incidents involving unacceptable excuses for  \"coaching\". I have seen athletes exhausted and burnt out because some coaches have no idea how to train athletes. After-school sports are the life and blood of many , with some depending on the sports they play for college and beyond, yet this situation is thought to be acceptable. In addition, this year’s track program has little to respect for student’s outside schedules, with draconian attendance and practice polices being enforced left and right. Believe it or not, while students lives may revolve around sports, we still have activities outside of track and field. And so, to the Administration and anyone else complicit, I say this: SHAME ON YOU!"

You can then \"park\" literally 10 feet away from your class and you won't have to \"WALK the long and hard journey.\" Or just suck it up and get up earlier so you can arrive earlier to school. The parking lot is fair game to everyone\n\n[8939.

THEY SHOULD HAVE TO DO THE SAME.

I was really really high and my friends ditched me in the park, by myself, alone. I called them and they lied and said that they were on the other side of town but I looked at SnapMaps and they were in the same park. I walked back to my house, too high to get on my skateboard, praying to god that the police didn’t pull me over for obv being high. There’s a lot more shit that they did but I’m too high to remember.\n\nWeed is fun but only when you’re safe. Fuck fake people. I overdosed like 3 months ago and I went to the hospital and shit and you would think ppl would at least understand that I’m going through some shit and maybe to not be a complete asshole but I forgot, we’re in high school. What else do we do? ofc they keep on calling me gay and shit and they keep on calling me “sus” and all that. I forgot, we’re in high school. I think it’s obv who I am but idc anymore tbh. I’m so done with the ppl here who are dicks"

    content: "Doing this exact thing. It’s possible, but grading in APES is very, very specific of what they want out of you and there is a very thin buffer between an A and a B, but the retake policy is very generous. If you can keep on top of notes and assignments, and are proactive about retakes, it’s not terribly difficult to get an A. \n\nThe rigor in AP Bio is manageable and is fairly constant. If you did well in freshman bio you’ll do about the same in AP. If you get Mrs. Lee she’s an awesome teacher, she’s really nice and makes lectures understandable and at least somewhat engaging. The two classes stop overlapping after the first unit, so if you were banking on that, don’t."

(Armada, Hungrybox, Mango, Mew2King, and PPMD). There’s also classic players who used to be the best like Ken or KDJ. They still participate in tournaments but aren’t as good as the Five Gods.\n\neSports also have professional clans, like FaZe, Cloud 9, or OpTiC, just like real sports teams.\n\nYes, the athletes aren’t physically moving but they still have to be really good to get to where they are and it still takes a lot of skill to be that good.\n\neSports are real sports, people!"

- content: "8874. [2020] I really don't like it when people are mean to me, especially behind my back or they talk about me in-front of me. Telling my brother not to grow up like me ruined my whole day and I hope you're happy about that. You know how much I have suffered? Well you don't know, you don't know much mental trauma I have to go through everyday. Everyday I have to tell myself I'm a good person. Everyday I try to better myself by respecting people and improving my cons. I get mad at myself for shit I done in the past but I forgive myself because I'm a better person now. I been abused by several people for more than 5 fucking years. I don't tell this to anyone anymore because I forgave them. It's hard for someone who had been  kicked punched gossiped plates thrown at them judged to forgive people. I been judged by how I look and I look at the mirror everyday and take pictures of my face everyday to prove to myself I'm not ugly. I been doing this for years now. I changed my appearance just so I could see who really respects me and it works because tons of people judge me for it and now I know who to trust and who not too. Because there's a shit ton of fake people in this world and now I know who they are. Last year I got cuts all over my body and my forehead from fights with someone and coming back and being treated the same way but emotionally is fucked up. You don't know how many people I had to protect because they hurt me. I don't Judge anyone because I know how it feels to be fucking judged. I'm not telling a quarter of what I been through. I try to be kind to everyone because I just know how it fucking feels to be in the lowest of the fucking sewer. Being misplaced in a. special education to cover up my bad grades from physical and mental abuse sucks ass but oh well. I hope you're happy now you ruined my day. I know this is what you want. But if you come near me I'll fuck you up. But of course I won't because I'll see myself in you. A insecure asshole. Something of the past. I got my laptop broken by someone I got my forehead slashed by them. I had cuts and bruises all over my body. I want my brother to better himself and you come and tell him not to be like me. Of course I don't want him to be like me I don't want him to go through what I went though but I want him to respect others and work hard and believe in himself. and man I just don't know why you would say that to me. You seemed friendly but hey people change all the time so you're probably going through shit too. I know you probably think I'm a loser because of rumors and shit but hey if you want to know me talk to me. Don't avoid me and then talk to others about me. That's some weak shit I used to do that all the fucking time. Come and talk to me in real life. Tell me how messed up I am and why I'm such a loser and look into my fucking eyes motherfucker. I used to cry myself everyday because I couldn't sleep because of all the physical abuse and all the rumors. I know I'm not perfect I used to do things that hurt other people and I didn't realize what I did until later and I beat myself over these things all the time.But I too forgive myself otherwise I will never become better. But I just want to let you know those words hurt me so much because I been trying to improve myself for a long time now. I'm a better person now, I respect others even if they hate me for my past. I don't expect an apology though because well I'm not sure if you care. You can lie to me and say it was a joke but motherfucker you're lying to yourself, I know you don't like me. I know when people smile at me with their eyes wide open they're judging."

- content: "8778. [2020] PLEASE READ: STANDARDS-BASED GRADING\n\nTLDR; come to the Board meeting tomorrow to speak up about your opinions on removing homework as a part of your final grade for a class or comments on Standards-Based Grading as a whole. Meeting is at 25 Churchill Avenue. Discussion will probably begin around 8 PM.\n\nThe upcoming School Board meeting this Tuesday (1/14) is an important one. The Board will have a discussion on amending Board Policy pertaining to Grading and Evaluation of Student Achievement. This paragraph will be added to the current document:\n\n\"A teacher shall base a student's grades solely on the quality of the student's academic work and his/her mastery of course content based on district standards. Students shall have the opportunity to demonstrate this mastery through a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, tests, projects, portfolios, and/or class discussion as appropriate. Other elements that are not a direct measure of knowledge and understanding of course content, such as attendance, effort, student conduct, and work habits, shall not be factored into the academic grade but may be reported separately.\"\n\nI believe this new grading policy is a precursor to the implementation of Standards-Based Grading where academic and behavioral aspects of learning are separated and behavioral aspects will no longer be factored into your final grade. While not explicitly stately, through my conversation with administrators, homework would be considered a behavioral aspect of learning. Effectively, this amendment to Board Policy allows the Board to remove homework as a factor into academic grades.\nRead the entire document here: https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/pausd/Board.nsf/files/BKNTMJ749F07/$file/20200114BP5121GradesEvaluationOfStudentAchievementPROPOSED.pdf\n\nIf you have any opinions about this change that will impact thousands of middle and high schools students in the future (you should!), PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE come to tomorrow's Board meeting to share it. One or two students giving speeches will not be enough for Board members to realize the gravity of this change. \n\nTime: Jan. 14; Board meeting starts at 6:30 PM. However, I expect the Board to reach this agenda item around 8 PM. I'll keep everyone updated.\nLocation: 25 Churchill Avenue (main meeting room in the right side of the district office)\n\n--Claire Cheng\nclairecheng02@gmail.com"

How about next time you see someone you think might have friend potential, say \"Hey, cool shoes\" or \"Where did you get that sweatshirt?\" or \"Aren't you glad it's sunny today?\"..?"

They were part of a larger plan that also includes a lot of increased bus service, but some things i.e the mid-day 88 buses unfortunately got cut.\n\n(Also, PSA: If you take what was the 35 bus, it’s now the 21.) \n\nThe changes went through several “final” revisions, and were supposed to go into effect when the new BART stations in Milpitas and Berryessa (San Jose) opened, but BART has been delaying those for years, and the VTA decided to stop waiting and deploy the changes themselves. You can see all of the changes (and there are a lot, most of them elsewhere in the county) at http://newtransitplan.vta.org/.\n\nThe City of Palo Alto is considering covering some of the removed bus service with their Palo Alto Community Shuttle. Contact them at city.council@cityofpaloalto.org if you want to see this!"

    content: "This idea is great, but also, aside from a one-time show of\nappreciation/apology we should constantly show respect by fixing the habits and not being disrespectful in the first place. I’ve seen people straight up drop their lunch cartons on the floor and keep walking when they don’t want whatever’s left, and TONS of people ditch their lunch place without cleaning up at all. It is NOT that hard to walk to the nearest trash cans, or carry trash with you to throw on the way to class if you’re really in such a rush. It also doesn’t take much time to pick up trash you see, even if it’s not yours. It should be expected to say “please” and “thank you” to the hardworking people of the cafeteria/brunch line, not disregarded and then “compensated” once a year so disrespectful kids can shrug guilt off their shoulders."

Both Marxism and conservatism are uncommon views in this area, and as a result, members of both groups often downplay their political beliefs in public. Also, you called conservatives \"blind to the actual reality of things,\" which is comparable to someone saying, \"Democrats need to open their eyes!\"\n\n[8607. [2021] The amount of people who say that \"Gunn is so left-wing I'm hashtag oppressed for being a conservative uwu\" are just so blind to the actual reality of things. Like I don't know how to tell you this, but conservatives have never been radical or against the status quo. They want preservation of old and outdated ideals. I always tell people that I'm a \"democratic socialist\" to avoid people automatically assuming that I'm a USSR-worshipping tankie by saying that I'm a Marxist. Also, please learn that Marxism encompasses a wide variety of ideologies (I align most closely with anarcho-syndicalism).]"

Some ppl cheat in every way possible (asking for the EXACT test questions from their friends, \"accidentally\" dropping a piece of paper with answers on the ground during tests, etc.).\n\nWhat pisses me off is that there are some people like me who work their asses off without cheating and don't do so well on tests as the cheaters. It's really frustrating to see those who cheat get into top schools, when they really don't deserve it. \n\nI guess this is a question for all the people who literally find every way to cheat on tests (you know exactly who you are) . When you receive that college acceptance letter from your dream school, are you really proud of yourself? For me personally, I would feel so guilty and ashamed and I hope at one point in your life you feel the same."

- content: "8609. [2020] @8596\nYes, people should stop bringing down legacy peers who were accepted. It's rude. No one deserves to be reduced to their legacy status or blamed for taking advantage of the privilege they were born with or even blamed for having the privilege they were born with. We are all benefiting from the privilege we were born into, whether it means attending one of the best public schools in CA, living in Silicon Valley, etc.\n\nI have to say, though, that \"getting into Stanford and being from this area\" does not, in fact, \"[show] that you’re even more qualified.\" It's still important to acknowledge that legacies have a significant advantage over non-legacy applicants. And I don't think anyone believes legacies with \"3.0’s and zero [extracurriculars]\" are accepted into Stanford. StRaW mAn ArGuMeNt spotted. I'm on to you, dude.\n\nAll Stanford applicants, whether accepted, rejected, or deferred, I hope you know that you were probably qualified and legacy is just a way colleges choose between applicants--it's a factor out of your control. For the FEW people who are still pissed, I hope you're pissed at the college system and not at your peers.\n\n[8596. [2020] Ok this is my first confession just bc it annoyed me so much to the point where I had to say something. For all of you guys who are salty about the legacy kids getting into Stanford. I am also a legacy kid as my parent literally works there. I didn’t even apply. But for everyone who is throwing shots and getting salty just because ur other peers got in: grow up. It honestly shows the type of person you are. It’s different if their parents are donating thousands of dollars and buy their kids’ way in-now THATS unfair. Stanford is such a prestigious school and their standards are very high. On top of that, Stanford is a really diverse school. Do you really think they’d accept someone FROM THE STANFORD AREA who WAS NOT QUALIFIED? No, hun. If anything, getting into Stanford and being from this area shows that you’re even more qualified. You still have to be up to par to even be considered to such an elite school like Stanford. They aren’t out here accepting kids with 3.0’s and zero extra curriculars just because “there mom/dad works there”. Like it’s honestly so frustrating. Are u really going to bring ur other classmates down just bc they got in and u didn’t? Like grow up, man. This entire process is really frustrating and stressful for everyone. Look at it as a sign that maybe going to Stanford wasn’t in your fate after all and that everything happens for a reason. If they didn’t accept you then they don’t deserve you!!! Stay positive and stop throwing shots at ur classmates. ]"

I'm also pretty sure most people know that being a legacy means not necessarily being held to the same high standards as other applicants but regardless, still being held to high standards. If you are not a legacy, there is no point in complaining unless you do something about it. Submit an article to a magazine. Write to admissions. Trying to start a revolution on Gunn Confessions is like John throwing soma out the window in BNW :("

- content: "8598. [2020] @8596 You know when this perennial controversy came into relevance again, I initially felt a bit sympathetic for those that are targeted for getting into Stanford with legacy/faculty connections. But I am getting more and more repulsed by all these confessions posted trying to erase a blatant factor of privilege. I felt quite indifferent about this whole situation in the very first place as I didn't apply to Stanford (I feel like the school is overvalued so much that it has cast a toxic air over the entire Silicon Valley), but I am both shocked and amused by how far people will go to pretend as if those with connections don't have any sort of advantage.\n\nYes, there are \"salty\" people and calling people accepted w/ connections \"cheaters\" is wrong—because \"cheating\" implies that some rule is broken. Having a faculty/legacy connections that can significantly favor you is not against the rules. Now are the rules good? That is the debate to have.\n\nBut posts—including this as well as @8514, @8537, @8586—show that you don't get the point. Any serious person knows that legacy does not entail automatic admission. We have heard of students denied from Stanford in spite of their connections. To say that such connections have no bearing on the admission process—why, that's a lie and you all know it yourselves. It is absolutely ludicrous to somehow twist facts so much when you assert that this is 100% fair. You draw a line here by characterizing \"donating thousands of dollars and buy their kids’ way in\" as unfair. But why do you draw an arbitrary line there? Why should someone's familial connection to a faculty member be considered as a fair factor in admission?\n\nYou do realize that nobody is claiming somebody with a 3.0 GPA and zero extra curriculars can get into Stanford, right? The people seriously considered for Stanford are all very qualified—and those who have connections possess a significant advantage over this already extremely qualified pool of applicants, regardless of whether or not they are really the best for Stanford out of that pool. That is the heart of the debate we are having here. You go this far trying to cover for those with connections by asserting how they \"deserve\" to get in—but do those passionate and hard-working kids who just fell short from admission thanks to the legacy factor not deserve to get in Stanford? This isn't about \"bringing other people down\". This is complaining about a process that brings people down.\n\nIf anything, any of you going on Gunn Confessions to whine about how other people are unhappy about you getting into Stanford w/ connections is a sign of immaturity. You got in for a big part because the Stanford Admissions deem you are qualified and appropriate, but also undeniably due to your connections. Don't try to erase the fact you are privileged. Acknowledge that you are fortunate that you have those connections and others are less fortunate, and stop whining. Nothing kills me more than somebody crying over getting into Stanford because they have legacy connections. How about all of those who shed tears because they did not get into Stanford—those who may love the school just as much as you? It bewilders me how much the Gunn community is willing to defend privilege, while not giving a crap about those who are less fortunate.\n\nAgain, I do hear this other conversation about how most people at Gunn are privileged with great education to begin with. That is a good conversation to have. However, in the context of criticizing the Stanford legacy factor, that just detracts from the topic at hand—because the legacy factor is much more egregious than any of other forms of legal advantages/privileges entailed. If we want equity, there is an order of operations. Just first eliminate this arbitrary and nepotistic legacy factor from admissions. Most European universities have done so already."

I think the intention is more to just try to let people be and be happy for people who get in whether they have legacy or not. I know this was not the poster’s intention, but I think that a lot of these posts talking about how it’s unfair for people who don’t have legacy cause the people who get in with legacy to feel as if they only got accepted due to their connections. Yes, the system is most definitely unfair, but so is life. And going to Stanford isn’t going to make or break your life. The majority of people who apply from Gunn are definitely qualified and if they don’t get into Stanford they will still get into another great school and do great things with their life."

All those of you stressing and gossiping about college, remember this: top SV companies are full of grads from all over the place. NO ONE CARES where you go to school. What matters is what YOU as a person bring to the table. Plenty of top execs from no name colleges out there. Also plenty of Ivy, MIT, Caltech, Stanford grads who get fired from their jobs for being entitled and for performing poorly. Put this on REPEAT in you head regardless of what your friends and family say: THE COLLEGE NAME DOES NOT MATTER. YOU MATTER. Live happily. That's all."

I really appreciate how Gunn Rock Club cares about student mental health and are actively trying their best to make a difference in students' lives, but I would also really appreciate if they tried a different method of relieving stress rather than holding a petting zoo. Many of these animals are animals of prey and don't like it when they are picked up, handled, and grabbed at by a lot of students. Although I do understand how this could be really stress-reliving and helpful to a lot of students, I am also sure the innovative and creative members of Gunn Rock Club could find another way to promote stress-relief without disrespecting these animals."

You may just need to get a little creative with your approach, possibly taking some time off to work and figure out your future path and how college should fit into it.\n\nIf you want some suggestions on what to read to put things into perspective, just let me know. Maybe start with this one, which my brother who is a college counselor at a high school recently sent my daughter (currently a sophomore): https://www.amazon.com/Where-You-Not-Who-Youll/dp/1455532681/"

    content: "listen, 3.6 is a good gpa. You will get  into a college, don't worry about that. As for the actual college, the material tends to be the same, as long as you go to the college that's right for you, with the courses ur interested in, you'll  be fine. High school GPA doesn't depict everything. You got SAT, essay, extra cir., etc. Relax a little bit :D"

You can do the same for weighed."

    content: "I don’t know what grade you’re in, but once you have more freedom in your schedule for English electives, you can pick a class specific to your reading tastes. We fortunately have far more variety in our English course choices than other schools (and our teachers’ generation), but the structure of lessons and grading system are actually beneficial to college preparation and personal improvement. I don’t know what bothers you most; Maybe the curriculum and choice of books seems drab and forced? Having to discuss and analyze literature you wouldn’t pick up otherwise at least allows you the opportunity to change your interest, even if you still hate it. I used to suck at reading Shakespeare and refused to pick up a single play or poem, and while I still suck, the forced involvement with it now has me genuinely enjoying Shakespeare and reading it outside of class, so maybe the same will happen for you. Sorry this was long and dorky, I know you were just trying to vent, but just bear in mind that the system and course selection we have is generously more extensive and empathetic towards students’ interests than our teachers had, and I suggest asking staff or students for more insight on different classes to fully take advantage of it."

However, what about the reverse of this Rule? If there is no porn of it, it does not exist. This is the unspoken dark side of The Rule. I quickly asked myself \"is there porn of me?\". I nervously typed in my name on some popular porn sites. I didn't find anything. As I went from one porn site to the next, dread slowly filled me. Pornhub. The Rule remains true. Xvideos. The Rule remains true. Youporn. The Rule remains true. I got desperate, so I went to more obscure and niche websites. Hentai Haven. The Rule Remains true. Nhentai. The Rule Remains true. Hanime. The Rule remains true. I even visited the dark web looking for anything. Even a crayon drawing would do. But as I clicked on the last porn website and typed in my name, I realized that I was slowly fading out of existence. Quickly I opened Adobe Photoshop and started drawing porn of myself. It was the only way. Head, body, arms. I was 25% gone. Legs, feet, knees. I was 50% gone. Now all I needed was the dick. This was the challenging part. I drew and I drew. I was 75% gone. My dick took up most of the canvas. I was 90% gone. I was almost done. I just needed the tip. I was 99% Gone. When I finished I was relieved. Somehow I had broken the rule. And when I noticed, reality began to collapse. Everyone should make porn of themselves to be safe. So yeah, that's why you should send me nudes."

And I second what William said, don’t overload on APs, they often require a lot of work and will impact how much time you can spend in other classes. Other than that, it’s probably worth looking at average GPAs of students who applied to the schools using the scattergrams on Naviance or using Niche.com."

- content: "8227. [2021] Sheer pomposity seems to be the first thing a new student recognizes in Mr. O’Connell. Almost every 10th grader knows that he acts as though he were deemed chief chemistry teacher by the almighty himself. He is sure that he is the paladin of education, swearing to his sacred “life teachings” beyond all limits of objective evaluation. It seems he is entirely unaware of his questionable egotism--blaming students’ difficulties with the class not on his endless hours of lecturing about the vain imaginary student, ‘your friend’, but instead projecting the qualities of ‘your friend’ onto them as the reason for their struggle. The rallying against ‘your friend’ ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy, for when students display even the slightest complaint against his class, he sees them as ‘your friend’s, degrading them to mere grade-grabbers and not true learners of conceptual O’Connell™ philosophy. Still, in his unawareness of himself, when students end up having to study hours outside of class, he deems his class and teaching style a great success.\n\n^I wrote this meme-y paragraph while I still had OC. My perception of him has changed a lot actually since I wrote it, he is actually a really nice guy\nChem1 gang G period!!!"

Ur the fake one. I agree that in middle school I deserved that shit but fr holding grudges against somebody till high school is so toxic. In middle school I was that kid nobody liked and now I have like 2 close friends and that's it bc everyone holds a grudge against me for being that kid which made people say: \"\"ew, he's disgusting\"\". \n\nSome people man, some people. Every friend I've had has been told not to hang out with me because I'm weird or annoying or whatever the fuck ppl say. \n\nEven for the people that I'm friends with, even for them, I'm just that kid who nobody really hates enough to ditch but nobody likes enough to invite to places. I'm just that kid who's there."

If anyone reading this wants to set up an appointment for me, I would be more than happy to make a presentation about it to anyone who is interested. I have been talking with various schools in the Bay Area about Challenge Day and think that it would be a great thing to have at Gunn school-wide, or at least across an entire grade."

It's not my fault that I like his ideas but you outright are cutting my freedom of speech by calling me a white supremacist because how do I reply to that if everyone agrees with it. My previous comment was based on how different opinions are not welcome not on supporting trump. All the comments were based on supporting trump is bad. You don't realize how you have singled me out. Just because I support his policies, how am I racist. I did not say I support all his policies, I said certain policies that are good. Please stop this hate. \n\nI feel so embarrassed to share my opinion because people are automatically going to stereotype me as racist."

I really dislike SELF, and I know a lot of people do too.\nIt s a waste of 50 minutes, learning about something that should be applied in our lives, however, it is either something we've already learned in our life, or it's something too naive and simplified to be work in reality.\nAnd it's really funny how they always talk about relieving stress from students when really SELF is just taking away time people have to either study or to just hangout with their friends.\nLike, okay Gunn.\nThank you for making my life so much easier and stress free!\n\nBut that's not my only issue with SELF.\nIt's the fact that, as someone who's going through depression, and has friend and family issues, a lot of the topics brought up in SELF are triggering for me. And when they portray it as something super two dimensional and fixable, and when they say it's a big deal but act like it's not, it hurts.\nA lot.\nBut it's not like I can just get up and leave or get mad or show my emotions because then people will know and my SELF teach will be like, \"Omg, share you situation and we can dissect is and figure it out together!!\"\nI have never met teachers with lower EQ than that.\nLike maybe you're okay with sharing your problems, but I'm not. \nAnd it sucks when people force you to open up. So you end up bottling it up and you feel really bad and right after is Day 3 B period, and then I have a test and I'm feeling really bad from SELF and I do bad on my test.\nLike ok.\nHelpful Gunn. Really really really helpful. \n\nAnd that's not my only issue with Gunn. \nIt's the fact that they portray it as such a happy, friendly, open school. Like it's got nothing to hide. \nBut needless to say, Gunn friend groups are literally set in stone. You can't get in, and if you get kicked out, the gates locked behind you.\nSo, how exactly do you make friends if you didn't have friends from middle school?\nRight, you don't.\nBig brain moments.\nSo, as someone who's only friends go to other school, it too socially awkward and mentally weak to try and find friends, when am I happy at Gunn?\nDuring FLEX when I'm playing video games with my Paly friends.\nThat's when.\n\nSo.\nYeah.\nGunn sucks.\nThank you for reading this you're the best we should rebel against Gunn and nobody goes to SELF because SELF is dumb and FLEX>>>>> SELF ok I'm tired bye."

- content: "7873. [2016] I never had OC, but I keep hearing stories from my younger brother who had him for chem H and I can’t help but wonder how he still teaches at Gunn. Last year OC shook hands with everyone in the class on the day of the final, then when he got to one student he said: “you deserve a hug,” and hugged him. To the next student he said, “you don’t deserve a hug,” and shook his hand. Can you imagine how you would have felt if this happened to you? This is unbelievable. Aside from the fact that he’s a teacher and is obligated to treat all of his students equally and with respect, you just don’t do something like that. As a person, as a human being. These kids work their ass off, and suffer because of his ridiculous requirements, like having a good handwriting. I mean, chem H is hard enough without having to worry about your handwriting! I am so disappointed in Gunn for hiring teachers who behave this way for so long. My experience at Gunn had been mostly pretty good, and hearing these stories makes me feel really sad. If you got hurt or ever felt not good enough or not smart enough because of OC, I am really, really sorry. And please don’t take it personally. You are amazing and brave for not dropping the class, for working so hard and showing that you care, and that you don’t let someone else ruin your sophomore year of high school. I don’t know how many of you agree or disagree with me, but it was important for me to post that because I am sure that my brother is not the only one who doesn’t have many fond memories from chem H with OC. I apologize if I offended you in any way. Thanks for reading if you got this far :)"

Only about 40% of the student population is being represented. Student government needs more diversity. By commenting on this post and saying yes, BUT... and then adding some excuse, you’re not making a difference, especially if you’re Asian and on student council, you’re just trying to defend yourself. Individuals aren’t the problem, it’s the non diversity of people’s views.\n\nThere was a comment that said that “sounds a lot like the American government.”\n\nI don't agree with you. Yes I agree that there needs to be a hell of a lot more diversity but you saying there is no diversity in the American government seems to be justifying the reason why it is okay to have little diversity in the SEC.\n\nHaving said that I agree that we voted for certain people and who chose to be on SEC. \n\nYou can disagree with me but be polite."

- content: "7764. [alum] @Every post asking about why people dislike Linsdell's class (including 7746, 7682):\n\nSo these may not be the main things but they were some main things I noticed. Also note that details have changed to avoid sharing specific stories, and that the goal of this post is not to give a comprehensive evaluation on Linsdell or her teaching, but rather to warn students of some of the things that could occur (and have occurred) in her classes.\n\n1. If you have any shortcoming that makes you deviate from being a \"good student\", expect to answer for it in front of the class. This can range from one mistake you made one day to an ongoing behavior lapse. (And it did – being a \"good student\" most of the time didn't excuse you from being singled out in front of the class on the day you forgot a pencil.) You can bet on that it won't be discussed in private or with any degree of confidentiality.\n\n2. She has also sometimes approached students and singled them out by asking them to represent their racial and/or ethnic identity to the class (e.g asking about a specific political event, asking if they would want to choose a project relating to their specific identity, etc)\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to evaluate Linsdell as a teacher, much less as a person. This post is based on the assumption that, while students deserve for these things not to happen, if they are likely to happen, students deserve to know."

Don't ever expect an A, but when you get shafted by some bad grades, don't let that demotivate you and keep up the hard work. Let's just say I got shafted one test, and then the next test I shafted the test so bad that I shafted the curve too. big loss cancelled out my big dub. how well you do on one test/lab wouldn't determine how well you do on the next."

OC still wants you to care about your grade and for you to improve it. What he doesn’t want is for anyone to partake in a discussion about their own or someone else’s grades. He once told our class that grades were like underwear, no one wants to see your underwear. No one wants to see your grade. You wouldn’t show your underwear to others, so please don’t show your grades to others either."

I do recommend watching some YouTube videos about music theory on the side cause it’s good to here different explanations for different concepts, plus looking up more advanced theory can spark more interest for the subject, and spark creativity in your compositions.\n\nThe more curious you are, the more fun you’ll have and the better you’ll do."

First week as always will be crazy, but you can still contact  counselors. Or wake up hella early on the first days. If you want a G prep drop that class boi or get G prep PE do sports. Second, I would suggest getting head start on colleges essays and studying. Third, while I want you to worry and understand the feel of deciding your future. Enjoy the rest of the time honestly I am a choir and theatre kid. If I never decided to join who know what happens, but I love all my fellow friends who are moving up. Trust yourself and you will be where you need to be. It may seem stressful, but I believe in every one of you."

This allows you to really work towards getting an early decision (Probably around 5th or 6th grade). You're probably going to have to do 2 years at Foothill or De Anza then transfer to a UC to finish your 4 years -- there's really no way to get into a good college unless you start in the toddler years."

    content: "Easy ways to start are looking at things like Naviance to see where you fit in terms of test scores / GPA and how many Gunn kids they accept every year to determine if it's even worth applying. You can also easily rule out colleges by location (you have to live there for four years), size, housing, and how good the department is for the major you want to study. You should also poke around on the college websites because you can get a vibe. Just making a common app account can relieve a lot of stress because a lot of it is mindlessly inputting your family information, test scores, classes, etc. and you will still be getting stuff done. I promise it becomes less scary when you start."

With college application season coming up, here’s some fun information about community college (foothill specifically):\n•the class sizes are a lot more similar to highschool, that means you can actually get to know your professor unlike in a lot of big universities where class sizes are 100+. My biggest class size so far has been 75 in a lecture hall and 30 in that class’s lab\n•Foothill has a lot of agreements with UC’s called “TAGs”, if you get a TAG to a school, you’re guaranteed admission\n•you do not have to take the SAT/ACT to get into foothill or to transfer to a 4 year\n•the UC application is four questions and your answer has a limit of 250 words per question maximum \n•your highschool grades don’t matter, unless you want to prove you passed a language so you don’t have to take another language or you want to use your AP scores to bypass beginning classes"

I felt that Foothill did a wonderful job preparing me for Berkeley. The professors are amazing, there is a great diversity in classes, and the transfer center/college advisors are excellent. Foothill, De Anza, Cañada, West Valley, and all the other surrounding community colleges are fantastic. If you are hoping to go to a good UC, but your high school resume isn’t quite there, community college is the way to go. Just wanted to put that out there."

So I recommend concentrating on trying to learn more, understand how to learn better (for example, how to improve note-taking skills, use flash cards, the value of reviewing notes and \"teaching\" the material you've learned), thinking about what you want to do with your future and how to be the best person you can be. Better grades will naturally follow if you are doing all the above. Everyone wins! :-)"

One time in middle school, I couldn’t cope with my emotions well and I deadass hid under a table during a lab. I felt so excluded and that’s the worst feeling in mankind. Anyway, all I can say is this. It’s hard, but it’s harder that some popular kid is not expanding their network by only working with their friend. That’s their loss. They have so many awesome people they’re missing on including you. For now, all I can say is to smile BIG and be confident even if it’s fake (no one will know).\n\n[7489. I never had many friends thru out high school and the most terrible feeling ever was having to pick a group or specifically a single partner for a project and having absolutely nobody want to b w you. I can live w knowing other people have closer friends who they wanna partner w I can’t be salty over that: BUT BY GOD IF U EVER SAW SOMEONE SITTING BY THEMSELF??? And u didn’t invite them in to join ur group?? Shame on you. Idc if u just wanted to work w your bestie and chat but come on now... most embarrassing moment of high school for me was having to walk up to mr. Hernandez and tell him I didn’t have a partner and we had to wait a week until someone else from class would roll their eyes and sacrifice themself to partner up with me. Like literally fuck you... honestly so rude... gave me so much anxiety whenever a teacher said to chat with someone near you because nobody would sit near me... at all. Like entire class was full except for a two chair radius surrounding me. The looks people gave each other that annoyed look when I asked “can I join you guys?” God so rude... or the rare times some poor person came late and the only seat left was next to me andthey were forced to talk to me I would talk ab my opinion or whatever we were suppose to discuss then they’d say “oh cool” nod then look away and sit in silence next to me... like ummm? I always thought maybe there was something wrong with me like maybe I was too loud or ugly or annoying but nah I just realized now that other people are just rude and couldn’t socialize well with people they didn’t want to.

I was one of the most rejected, ostracized, and picked-on kids in high school. But now I am someone thousands of people look up to for advice and support. And if you want someone to talk with, I'm here for you. \n\nTo everyone else: If you see someone sitting alone at school TALK TO THEM. At least say How are you doing? and then LISTEN to them when they answer. As this person said, it's fine to have your favorites and more friends than others. But nobody should have nobody (=Everyone should have someone). You might be surprised how interesting someone is whom you'd been ignoring or hadn't noticed. I had a great talk with a homeless guy the other day. I talk with strangers all the time. And I am happy to report that I have saved lives through talking with people. And YOU CAN TOO. Reach out to people who look like they could use a friendly Hello. Every once in a while, high-five a random person. Be the hero you've been looking for. Be the change you want to see in the world. \n\nAnd yes, this goes for everyone reading this...If you want someone to talk with, just give me a shout. Just realize that it might take me some time to get to you if you write to me through FB, since the system filters out messages from people not connected to each other. You can use jon@svkarate.com to reach me directly."

We got access to the materials only a couple weeks before the start of school, but the assignment was short (maybe 2-3 hours  at most). It wasn't mandatory, only a little bit of extra credit. In terms of the content, most of it was actually review, since almost all of it was covered in analysis. I would expect either no summer assignment or a similarly short and easy one that will be released towards the start of next school year. If you want to see the summer homework from past years you can find it here: https://sites.google.com/a/pausd.org/dunbar-physics/class-b/summer-work-for-apc-physics"

    content: "Now does matter. But not as much for your future as most students are lead to believe. \n\nHow you do in high school matters quite a lot for where you can get into for college (if you decide to go to college). Where you go to college matters quite a lot for where you go to grad school or your first job (and then high school doesn't really matter). How you did in grad school or in your first job matters for the next job. Each time you advance through life, what you did a couple step back loses its importance a little and what you did before that loses importance even more. So yes, 10+ years after high school, what was stressing you out in high school will no longer seem very important. \n\nBut it is important to you now if you feel it is important. Just keep things in perspective when you are feeling stressed."

    content: "This is not true. The SFPD Pride Patches are not paid for through taxes.\n\nAccording to the San Francisco Police Department in a newsletter from just last week: \"This project [is] organized by the San Francisco Police Officers’ Pride Alliance\"\n\nThe San Francisco Police Officers' Pride Alliance is a non-profit organization managed by Castro Community On Patrol, which is a separate non-profit group of volunteers.\n\nWant to know where CCOP gets their money from? I'll give you a hint, it's not from taxpayers.\n\n\"We rely heavily on fundraising and donations from members of the community we serve.\" -CCOP\n\nI personally see the patches as a well intentioned, thoughtful and inclusive display of acceptance towards a community that has and continues to face oppression/resistance.\n\nNext time do some research before you get upset over a $2 patch."

Keep in mind that college math/science is pretty different, because usually, the classes are more tailored to your interests and not based on what the Collegeboard deems important for AP-takers to know.\n\nPlus, unless you now would rather study something else much more than STEM (a useful realization to have), you're probably experiencing burnout more than loss of passion for this particular subject.\n\nKeep these experiences in mind as you go forward in your educational career. Only you can decide what's right for you."

It was such like a casual thing but it was so kind and like something about it just really moved me. Samson didn’t want this person to feel bad later and went out of his way to help and idk man it was just so inspiring in a way. Samson, props to you"

- content: "7163. @7147 I think you have a bit of a misconception about how gunn theatre actually is. In previous years, gunn theatre was extremely rude and divided, and although people have had their differences this year, no one actually hates each other as far as I’m aware (which is a HUGE improvement from previous gunn theatre years) so please try to chill a little bit. Deniz and Arman have brought together Gunn Theatre in a way that no one thought was possible and have honestly and truly made it the least intimidating it has ever been! So kudos to them and please don’t bring everyone down by writing stuff like this on confessions...i know that it’s difficult to see the changes from a younger perspective, but two years ago, there was an actual sexual assaulter involved with theatre. In my opinion, we have vastly improved the quality of people in theatre while still managing to be welcoming to all. Nothing is perfect, but we can get as close as possible and I really think we’re improving! Please just don’t make generalizations like this that make everyone feel bad!\n\n[7147. I’ve been a part of the theatre community for some time now and I have to say, it’s kind of gotten bad. It’s supposed to be a safe, welcoming, and supportive community, and honestly, I don’t feel like it is anymore. This year it’s gotten really cliquey and people are mean and judgmental and everyone talks about each other behind their backs and it’s just gross. Obviously there are still a lot of awesome and supportive people in theatre, but a lot of them are mean and talk shit about people who are part of the theatre “family” which is so not what families should be like. This may be an unpopular opinion but I felt like I needed to share it.]"

- content: "7162. [2021] We can organize mass protests in front of the construction.\n\nI can imagine the rallying cries of a unified congregation, freshman and sophomores joining hand in hand.\n\n\"Tear down this wall!\" Heave, ho, the construction fence topples. The students press forth, their restrictions lifted. Like a single organism they move in savage strokes, clearing everything in their path. In hours the Gunn campus is cleared of construction materials, of construction machines, and of dissenting staff. The new building, they declare, will be used for science, math, English, and history classrooms. For then, they will truly be put to good use.\n\nSELF is promptly toppled and its organizers imprisoned, replaced with double Flex each Thursday. The Gunn students set up a democratic system of government, with several representatives elected from each grade serving in various public offices. Voter turnout approaches 95%. An effective bicameral legislature and judiciary are established, allowing freedom and equality for all Gunn students. School policies and their implementation are catalyzed by the opinions and motivations of the constituents -- the Gunn students -- and not by the hegemons of the current administration.\n\nInspired by the Gunn Revolution of 2019, students across PAUSD revolt and set up similar systems. A network of kinsmanship in both ideology and academic interest is established. Teams of hackers penetrate the former PAUSD systems and ban RapidIdentity, Securly, and other censoring systems. All issued Chromebooks are recalled and replaced with hacked Chromebooks using DuckDuckGo.\n\nThe students are, for the first time in years, happy. They have achieved an ideal one would think impossible for a group of naive high-school students: self-governance, freedom, and a fundamental equality.\n\nAlas, this is only a product of my imagination. But it never hurts to dream."

[2018] A year past my graduation it has dawned on me that Gunn High School is the most glorious hellhole the world has ever seen, as traumatic, terrifying, and utterly excruciating my time was at Gunn, it made me more intelligent and has allowed me to intellectually dismantle lesser humans... so my tip to all those struggling in the realms of high school; take your education seriously but more importantly get some help if you’re stressed out because truly going through Gunn High School alone would be worse than torture"

They may not earn you a living right away. But you may be able to develop them in such a way that someday they will. \n\nI am living proof of that. \n\nPlease do not walk out on your parents.\n\nInstead, try talking things out WITH your parents. Talk about your concerns and how they compare to your mom's concerns. Good luck!"

They buys me new clothes and says I need to be grateful. They tells me they are going to cut all ties from me when I'm 18 and tells me to read this board that says \"Know that you are loved\" in the same hour. I don't do what they say, and they say I'm lying to them. They even called me the devil. That they wish I was never born. I feel so angry at them, but then sometimes they apologize and I don't feel that anger towards them anymore. But then they say it again, again, and again in future arguments. I don't know if this is just the perspective of a teenager, but I don't think this is right at all. I don't feel anything anymore. There sometimes jokes that everyone thinks is hilarious and I'm just sitting there, forcing myself to laugh with them so I don't feel left out. Maybe it's just my sense of humor is different from them, I don't know."

One of my friend's parent does not want her to talk to anyone who is in lower level classes, I mean COME ON. The teachers don't have passion anymore, as in the first thing they say is how much the grade of something is, the culture has rubbed on to them. I hope this shitty culture changes, the passion comes back and kids take classes cause they want to and not cause of AP's, parents, etc"

However, the good news is that your grade is scaled, and a 70% or higher is considered an A, 60% or higher is considered a B, and you only need a 40% to pass. In terms of grading, you don't start from a full score, and deducted points when you make a mistake. You start from 0 points, and the grader adds points when they see something that they like. That's another reason why 70% is an A. Overall, I like this system because there's no repetitive homework. And yes the assignments are pretty difficult, but it's university. This is at King's College, and I'm sure other UK universities have slightly different metrics. Regarding the 3 year bachelor, 4 year masters thing--I love that. Why wouldn't you wanna get your degree faster?"

- content: "6747. From the perspective of other people, my life is pretty great. My grades are good. I have lots of friends. I attend a great school. My future is looking bright. My family is proud of me.\n\nFrom my perspective, I don’t really see it the same way. Of course, I am, as my family is, proud of my accomplishments and the hard work that I’ve done to achieve them. However, sometimes I just sit at home, alone, and think to myself. \n\nI wrote the previous sentence as I did because that’s what I usually am when I’m not at school: alone. It’s not necessarily sad; sometimes I’m happy when I’m alone. It’s just a fact. I’m not invited to many things by almost anyone. I’m usually just the guy that people sometimes talk to when they need help (more on that later). Sure, I have lots of friends. But I don’t seem to have that “spark” that other people have with their friends, a spark that seems to connect two people stronger than I might ever be able to.\n\nSometimes, I do an activity that is considered nerdy among my friends because I think it’s fun (I chose not to include the activity explicitly to preserve anonymity). Yet, I find myself calling myself a nerd and a loser in my head for doing it. I know I shouldn’t, but I have formulated a toxic environment in my own head that has evolved over time to adapt to what others think of me. I, instead of being myself, have become an amalgamation of what others expect of me. (To be clear, I’m not blaming Gunn for this.)\n\nSimilarly, I find myself staring intently at people whom a heterosexual person of my gender would not stare at in the same way. Obviously, I know that it is completely acceptable to be non-heterosexual, but deep down, my conscience tells me to keep it a secret. I always deny accusations and suggestions made by others about my sexuality, while I am not sure of it myself, and it causes me a great deal of distress.\n\nLastly, as I’ve said, my grades are great, my parents are proud, etc., and this isn’t really a secret among my friends. The downside of this is that I tend to be the person from whom people always ask for help. For those who aren’t like this, I’d just like to say: it’s difficult. It’s a difficult task to be expected by someone to know something, only to let them down if you don’t. It’s difficult to see the disappointment on someone’s face when you can’t answer. And if you can answer, then that only feeds their ever-growing habit of asking you for help in the first place. Currently, I am “carrying” a few people in some classes, and my back is getting weak. My point here is this: don’t take the people you ask for help from for granted. They work hard. Be grateful that they help you at all.\n\nI’d like to conclude with saying that I appreciate in advance any comments along the lines of “message me” or “you’re not in this alone,” but this isn’t a pity post. I’m not looking for help or attention. The purpose of this post is to show what is like to be a “smart person,” even though the word “smart” has no real meaning. (In the following sentences, I crudely refer to “smart people” as “we” and “everyone else” as “you.”) We don’t have it easy. We’re like you. We all have struggles. You don’t actually “wish you could be” us, just the same as we don’t wish to be you. Each of us looks at the other and sees what they are missing.\n\nWe all want what we don’t have."

As with sexuality, personally, I used to be in the same place and I was never comfortable with being Bisexual, for years. There's absolutely nothing wrong with questioning your sexual orientation, you don't have to fit a label: gay, bi, straight, whoever you are. I personally struggled with it for years but I eventually got comfortable enough and thought about it enough to the point where I was comfortable enough to come out. Hope you get there too. Also, people are nicer than you think. I've never met a single homophobic person, and my super Indian family was even really supportive when I told them. Just remember that 99.9% of people will still support you no matter what."

It sucks how schools teach you the message that all drugs are dangerous because that means we don't get any education on what's safe and what's not, dosages, etc"

- content: "6618.  @6606 First of all, most abortions not are jamming metal rods into the fetus’ head. The abortion method you are probably referring to is called dilation and evacuation, however that has been banned since 2003 and only accounts for 0.2% of all abortions. Don’t parenthesize “this is what happens” when most of the time, it’s not what happens. About 91% of all abortions in 2015 happened during the first trimester, meaning prior to the 13th week of the fetus’ conception according to the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). This means most of the abortions are either vacuum aspiration, where the contents of the uterus are sucked out, or medicine-induced abortions. The abortion procedure you’re referring to happens in the second trimester, and in that trimester, the mother needs consent from a doctor and it only happens IF the women needs protection according to the ruling of Roe v. Wade. However, these rules have changed and the regulations have most likely gotten stricter since the Supreme Court has gotten more conservative and are allowing regulations that contradict Roe v. Wade to slide. In the third trimester, since the fetus can survive outside of the mother, she cannot abort UNLESS her health is in serious danger. The states can say the mother can’t abort since the baby now can survive without life support. So your comment on Democrats saying you can abort until birth is incorrect, because there is a ruling that says otherwise. After the first trimester, it’s no longer just the woman’s decision. But even so, at the end of the day, it’s the woman’s decision to abort. Even if abortion is illegal, the women will still do it for reasons like they aren’t ready to have a child, emotionally, physically, and/or economically. Bearing that kind of responsibility changes your life forever. Even if you don’t agree with abortion, I don’t believe people should antagonize other people for it. It was their choice, if you had to make that choice, maybe you wouldn’t make it, but they shouldn’t be disrespected because they did what they thought was best."

- content: "6588. [2019] To the person who asked about college regrets, here were mine:\n1) I didn’t apply to enough “match” and safety schools. I got a LOT of rejections from the prestigious schools all at once. Although I expected them, having a lot all at once was overwhelming. \n2) Assuming you want to stay in California, don’t only apply to the UCs and USC. UCs are hella unpredictable and USC as well (for example, I know someone with a perfect 4.0, 36 ACT, and had legacy and still was rejected). Apply to those schools if you wish, but also apply to some other schools catered to your liking. \n3) I regretted not finishing my essays by the end of summer. So, start your essays NOW. You will NOT want to finish them during first semester of senior year. Get on the grind and crunch out those essays. You can recycle a lot of them too.\n4) Not applying ED/EA for all my schools. You’ll get it out of the way and you’ll be able to hear back sooner too. \n5) Listening to all the college app bullshit. People talk so much bs about apps, such as GPA, scores, all their extracurriculars, etc. It only made me feel worse about myself and doing that can negatively impact your mental health. At Gunn, it’s inevitable to not hear people talk about this stuff, but try and find friends who see eye to eye with you."

- content: "6544. [2019] @6510 Caltech actually does not do legacy even if your parents work there they don't give you an advantage. It's basically all on merit. It's one of the only private schools that does that. Stanford and Ivy Leagues definitely have a legacy component but I just wanted to clarify that. Also in many industries UCs and schools like that are becoming more sought out and Ivy League students are not the only ones who get the interview. I am pretty sure there a lot of HYPSM students who don't get jobs over other lower-tier school candidates. If you work hard enough, follow your passion, and take advantage of your resources, no matter what school you went to, you can get a job and have a happy life. I agree that legacy is sometimes bad but don't attack people who got in because of it because it wasn't their choice that legacy is a thing.\n\n[6510. [2019] time to spill some hot tea:\n\nEveryone who says that where you go to school doesn't matter is lying, and they know it. Where you go to school matters–the people going to places like HYPSM this year are going to get that interview that people going to places that aren't as well known or highly regarded.\n\nThe thing is, where you go to school doesn't have to be everything. You'll just have to work a little harder to get the same recognition and resources. But also, people going places like UCs and MIT and Caltech 100% earned their spots. I have a lot more respect for people going community/UCs than people who are going to Stanford because their parents work there. I know it's hard to beat Stanford, but if you can't get into any other Ivys/MIT/Caltech without connections, do you really deserve to go there?\n\n(also, disclaimer: I got into a lot of pretty good schools (T20) without legacy/faculty, including my dream school.)]"

He tries to argue with the teacher and makes the stupidest and I mean STUPIDEST comments ever. He literally called us peasants yesterday because of our \"liberalness\" and fricking said 9 months of jail was too much for a man who sexually abused a 13-year-old girl. Furthermore, during the condom thing, he refused to participate and acted like it was gross and condoms shouldn't be a thing, YET he is anti-abortion and stuff and just wtf he makes me uncomfortable.

I used be so so excited about Gunn Confessions update and I would read every post. All the politics right now is honestly ruining the wholesomeness of this page. It's dividing a bunch of people and I see people attacking each other on their views?? There are spaces where political discussions are very encouraged, so I don't know why so many people are using this page as their platform. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE I just want to go back to the time when this page was just nice and funny and something that made my day."

To all the people saying that to get an abortion, you must prove you have been raped: In far too many cases, the person being raped doesn't come forward due to many reasons (shame, guilt, fear, etc.). So by telling people that have to prove that they were raped, that could put them through a lot of trauma that they aren't ready for. I am a guy btw, not sure how that is relevant, but some people seem to think it is."

I understand why it would be so incredibly difficult to have to talk about it, you can't expect people to blindly believe you. Some basic explanation would probably be enough in most places. (All of this is going with the assumption that abortion is moral.)"

She is constantly rude to her students and acts like we don't have feelings and then if someone does smith wrong by accident she yells at them. I mean forget being a teacher she truly should not be near any kids ever. And what's up with her only letting you make up one assignment per flex even if you have the time to make up more. I mean this woman has no logic and is causing so many of my friends serious stress and anxiety. She made a girl cry a few months ago cause she wouldn't let her take a firkin test in the TRC even though she has disabilty. She even kicked a girl out of class for standing for her friend when [teacher] made her friend rly upset. She legit needs to go. Like this behavior from a teacher is soooo not ok. like wtf"

So I guess in that way it's to impress others as a byproduct of impressing myself? lol"

And college is not for everyone so I’m glad you figured out your path.\n\n[6049. fav activity is watching all my fellow seniors posting their UCs or ivy leagues and knowing they gonna be paying more than 100,000 for the clout lol jk congrats u guys on ur schools everyone worked hard and all but imma be saving coin these next few years lol]"

- content: "6043. Just watched Avengers Endgame. It is the most glorified piece of garbage I've seen in a long time. What value that is left from the core characters of the MCU that was created through its earliest movies (Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, etc.) is thoroughly destroyed. Endgame turns out to be a mindless, jumbled mess of a dumpster that burned on for three hours too long. Not an iota of anything that is actually provoking and nuanced is found in Endgame. Even for a popcorn movie, it is unbelievably disappointing; it promises a ton for the climax, but the mindless CGI fights aren't even well done. All traces of potential that lingered from previous mediocre to bad MCU movies are disintegrated to dust in Endgame. I'm just glad that it ends the current Marvel phase so that we don't have to go through this insufferable hell of an experience for a while."

That’s because whenever I am, she calls me out and makes these “quizzes” just so I as well as the other latecomers lose points in their grade. What she doesn’t realize is that we are not always in control of when we arrive. She claims that being on time will “prepare you for college lectures”, but professors aren’t gonna call each individual latecomer out, as well as taking points away from their grade. I know this might sound rude, but it’s something that really pisses me off."

I've been struggling with body positivity ever since middle school and this year has been one of the best and worst. At the start of the school year, I weighed the lowest I have in the past 3 years, I was over the moon. I felt great, I thought I looked great, my mental state was amazing, but, ever since the new year came I've gained a lot of weight and it has been an obstacle in my everyday life. I just wanted to share what's on my mind. I'm exercising daily, trying to eat healthy, and trying to stay positive."

    content: "Oh yeah, it really depends on the class. For Precalculus, Mr. Deggeller needs more in-person help around the classroom. I go basically every class (sometimes he has released me early, though). Some things you would do include sitting in table groups and guiding discussions, tutoring people who have missed class(es) in a separate room, and going over students' mistakes on tests. Also, sometimes you check homework and write keys for worksheets/tests.\n\nI think Mr. Deggeller doesn't need in-person help for Analysis H classes (because it's an honors lane). I think you mostly write keys for worksheets and tests, and grade homework. Ask Drake Schiller, though, becaue he actually TA’d for Analysis H.\n\nBut honestly, it depends on the classes he teaches next year. In my four years at Gunn, he has taught a combination of Precalculus, Alg 2/Trig H, and Analysis H."

Yeah sometimes the class can be a bore, but if you claim to learn more from \"Wikipedia articles\" then by all means go ahead and learn from Wikipedia articles. No need to complain about a class that you signed up for. Let's be real, \"screwed up\" world views don't stem from an 11th grade history class. If someone has a certain viewpoint, not only are they entitled to it, but if it's as strong as most right-wing anti-SJW views, they will find a way to defend it. Rather than complaining about the lack of \"intellectually stimulating\" material in the lane 1 class that YOU signed up for, how about actively discussing your views with your teacher and make it stimulating. Stop pretending to be smarter than you are and blaming your issues on a class with a teacher who's probably doing the best they can? Shaming a teacher's curriculum on social media doesn't make you intelligent or bold, it makes you look and sound like a smartass.\n\n[5817: 5817. [2020] US History right now is honestly the worst class I have ever taken in my life. Not because it is difficult, but because it makes me lose my dignity. I am not sure it's just because of the teacher, but the quality of history taught in that class is really sub-par...]"

    content: "That's to decide if something is a binomial setting (whether you can use binomial distribution formulas on it). binary outcome(B), independent trials(I), number of trials is fixed(T), success probability is constant(S). For example let's say the probability of breaking a machine on any given day is 0.4. If the question is what is the probability of not breaking the machine for 4 days that satisfies the conditions of a binomial setting. Either you break it or don't break it (B), P(breaking on day 1) does not affect (P breaking on day 2) (I), number of trials is fixed at 4 days (T),  success probability is always a constant 0.4 (S)."

(And write a probability statement and draw a graph)\n\n(The above paragraph is also true for the geometric distribution where you check BINS instead)\n\nSince the sampling distribution for proportions and 1-prop z-interval are also derived from binomial, you must also check BITS then. \n\nThe 1-prop z test, 2-prop z test, and 2-prop z interval are also derived from binomial; however, we skip checking the condition for these inference methods since the collegeboard and AP teachers have deemed the entire process too long otherwise"

Here's a partial list of schools that have special policies around subject tests:\n\nREQUIRED\nCaltech, Cooper Union (for engineers), Cornell (for Arts and Sciences or Engineering), George Washington's BA/MD program,\nHarvey Mudd, MIT, McGill, Tufts (2 with the SAT; not required for ACT but still recommended)\n\nRECOMMENDED\nBrown, Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth, Duke (strongly), Emory, Georgetown (strongly), Harvard, Princeton, Rice, UPenn, Webb Institute, Yale\n\nALTERNATIVE (AKA you can use subject tests instead of the SAT/ACT if you so choose)\nColorado College, Hamilton, Middlebury, NYU, U of Rochester\n\nBasically, look up the policies of each school you're applying to individually. This website (https://www.compassprep.com/subject-test-requirements-and-recommendations/) is a good starting point, but it's safest to check their websites around application season because policies change from year to year."

    content: "What matters at the end of the day is that you try your best. Also, it doesn’t matter where you start, it matters where you finish. You can always start off at a junior college and transfer to an insanely good school (I went from Foothill to UC Berkeley). Even if you don’t graduate from an “insanely good school”, you can still be very successful. My dad went to the University of Utah (good school, but not “insanely good”), worked extremely hard, and ended up being more successful than guys who graduated from better schools. My dad had some guys work under him that graduated from Stanford. The bottom line is if you go to an Ivy League type of school, that’s awesome, but it by no means guarantees success. On the flip side, if you go to a school that isn’t as good, that doesn’t mean you’re a failure or not destined to succeed. Work hard, do your best, and success will follow. That’s the key to success."

[2021] I have a friend who's way prettier than me, but she's always reminding me how I'm really tough, boyish, and have ugly skin and hair, and how I'm completely mismatched: my eye color don't match my skin and my nose is way too tall for my face. Although she has helped me try and be a bit more feminine, she's also a constant reminder of how I'll never be as pretty or good as her. Whenever I talk about someone, she always points out that person's good points, and then tells me the complete opposite. I don't have any friends aside from her, and at this point, I'm afraid to show my face. I always cover it during photos and feel like wearing a paper bag over it 24/7. I'm told I'm ugly and not polite, kind (feminine traits) enough by almost everyone I know. What should I do?"

Don't force yourself to go to some school you're not that psyched about just because you feel like you'd be embarrassed if you stayed at Foothill or De Anza for an extra couple years and then found your way to a four year university. All paths are fine, and the amount of passion you have for something will take you much farther than the name of a university on a résumé."

People just have a messed up sense of humor sometimes but it's all just jokes and 99% of the time no one actually means any of it. I want to assure you that \"most\" of the guys would never have an intent to harm, insult, or make anyone uncomfortable.\n\n[5514. the attitude that a lot (not all ofc) guys at gunn have towards women, lgbt matters, or anything race wise scares me. I thought Palo Alto was a safe place where a poc lgbt girl could be herself and be respected for who I am and my choices but I feel truly unsafe at gunn. Not all of the guys say terrible gay/trans bashing jokes, or racial slurs, or things regarding women like property or trash. But the many that do truly scare me. Glad I’m graduating and going to a different school, hopefully I can find people who aren’t so objectifying, racist, homo/transphobic, or all around scary.]"

I lowkey wanna start a Love Live club next year because I love the anime and the music and the game so so much and I would love to meet new friends who also like it too but I'm so nervous of no one actually wanting to join or people calling me a weeaboo for liking it. I already deal with people making really gross loli jokes about the girls in the anime which all make me really uncomfortable cause its honestly such a cheery and cutesy show and I don't even wanna think about that kinda stuff when it comes to them. I just want a way to make new friends but the fear of the ridicule is just too much. I mean, I don't know of anyone else at school who likes it except me. I don't think anyone would even join."

It's a combination of both what your extracurriculars show and a subconscious tone that rises within your essays that is really easily shows whether you're being authentic or not."

They HAVE to learn those things to play their parts correctly.”\n\nHe wants this show to be played by people from all different races. There are real cases of serious whitewashing where it is bad thing, but please try to understand that this is not one of them."

    content: "You might not be able to control how you feel, but you’re in control of your behavior/actions. Loving someone is a choice that you decide to commit yourself to. If I were you, I would think about why you’re potentially having feelings for someone else (like trying not to assume anything bc idk your relationship, but like maybe there is an issue with your current relationship that you and your partner haven’t addressed and it’s making you unsatisfied. Or you’re just simply falling out of love with them). If you still want to stay with your current partner, you should probably distance yourself away from the person you have feelings for so those feelings go away and spend that time trying to bond with your s.o.  In the end, the status of your relationship mostly depends on what you and your partner decide to do. Try and be transparent with them and communicate as clearly as you can bc communication is supeerrr important when it comes to relationships, especially during a rough/confusing period"

    content: "This – straight people dominating queer spaces – can be a real problem. However, also note that many people who appear to be straight may be queer in a way that is not easily visible, or they may be closeted – sometimes even to themselves. (On that latter note, there is a substantial trend of \"overly-obsessed straight allies\" turning out to be queer.) And excluding queer people for not stating or understanding their queerness, even though it usually happens by mistake, can sever them from crucial recourses and connections."

But recently I’ve been watching college acceptance videos and seeing/ hearing people from those and gunn say they have all A’s and need this to get into this school and whatever it’s just all catching up to me now and I’m getting rlly scared. I’m not the worst at school but I definitely don’t have all A’a, maybe 1 or 2 counting PE if I’m lucky. I’m also just scared of being made fun of for not getting into a good college now, I know that’s subjective about a “good” college but you know what I mean. The top schools or the most well known ones. And I have no idea what I want to do with my life it’s rlly freaking me out that I’ll go no where bc I have no passions and 0 passion for anything. I know I’m lazy but I have no drive and when I do it’s for maybe a a week if even. Im just so scared."

Also you still have a few years to find something you’re passionate about so I suggest trying out different clubs or programs that you find appealing...if one doesn’t work out then try something else and keep yourself open to new ideas. And prestige of a school doesn’t matter, what’s most important is that you know where you’ll be most successful and happy, and people will support you no matter what"

When I see a school production with not a lot of Latino students doing it, I know they’re learning things about Latino culture that go beyond what they’re fed in the media every day. They HAVE to learn those things to play their parts correctly.”\n\nHe wants this show to be played by people from all different races.

- content: "4049. The reason why I've never voted in a SEC election is because everyone generally has the same platform of positivity, inclusion, student voice, and school spirit so there's not much of a difference between candidates, since honestly, anyone running for SEC cares a ton about the school and student body and will do a good job. Low turnout doesn't really mean anything bad about SEC, a lot of the time it's because there isn't a superior candidate that I know I'm voting for. SEC elections generally do come down to popularity, due to candidates all sharing a similar vision for their class and the whole school, but that's more a testament to everyone being great than anything bad."

I don't really know that much about SEC, but I know for sure that they are really trying hard for us and our school. I understand that taking out ONE flex time and making everyone to be in a crowded space can be really annoying, but please don't spread hate towards people who are genuinely willing to work their asses off to improve the gunn community and future events. SEC may look like a clique made up of popular people, but please do realize that they are the ones who are dedicated enough to spend days, weeks, and months, planning and discussing about activities. SEC is not perfect; they can make mistakes too and some planning might not work well due to lack of participation or interests among gunn students! I hope more people can appreciate them for planning a fun homecoming week, rally, game, event, and more. \"If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid.\" - Mercedes Lackey"

    content: "hey !! j wanted to say that i totally understand your viewpoint and i do understand the value of not voting. it's a bit like negative space rlly, in the sense that it's a conscious lack of something. if the voter turnout is low, that indicates to SEC that there is a gap present between it and the student body, a disassociation from it. Therefore, SEC will work to close this disparity. However, communication needs to be there. If SEC doesn't communicate to the student body about what it does in the school community or if the student body doesn't bring up concerns with SEC, the disparity will remain.

- content: "3929. With the amount of sexual assault confessions and everything going around, I think it's time we, as a group, do something stronger. \n\nBy all means, I'm NOT saying that victims \"don't try\" or anything like that. As a fellow victim, I know how hard it can be to open up to people; it's a terrifying experience. Constantly feeling like you can't trust people, or that they're going to hurt you again. But that's why I think we, the victims, should open up to each other; as a group. \n\nThe issue of sexual assault is so unknown because it is hardly talked about publicly; and that's why the school doesn't care. I think it's because a lot of people are so silent about it (understandably so, though). But in result of that silence, the staff doesn't see a problem with it. If we united and showed how truly upset we all are, the staff would take heed. The staff would take heed, and the attackers would see how they went wrong. \n\nIt is through silence that nothing goes through; like watching still water and waiting for it to ripple. But if we unite, to cause that ripple, they could see; the root problem, and how the root problem keeps causing more and more ripples. \n\nOnce again, I'm not saying that the victims don't try; because they have all the reason in the world to feel scared. But we're all scared; we're all scared together, and if we're together, we can show them all how bad of a problem it really is so we can all work on fixing it together. I'm honestly terrified of posting this; as I'm writing the thought keeps going through my mind \"You should stop. Nobody will agree with you,\" but part of me also says \"If we share the adversities together, and overcome it, we can see there the problems are, and face the fears together.\" If you're scared, we'll be the voice for you; I'll be the voice for you\n\nI believe that if one person can fight such doubts; you can too. And if we unite, fighting our anxieties, fighting such misconduct, fighting what seems to be the impossible, I truly believe that we can make a difference at this school and send a message about how serious of an issue this is.\n\nIf you're interested in making posters, speeches, ANYTHING; please feel free to drop a comment below and I'll be more than happy to DM you"

So many people are right there with you, and if we come together and open up more; anonymously or not, I do think that we can spark more awareness at this school. \n\nIf the Gunn staff doesn't do much about the situation, I think it's fair to take initiative to spread awareness of how this is a real issue. If nothing else, if there's enough people outwardly sharing their stories, the shock of it all would probably catch the school's attention, and the attention of the attackers. \n\nWe're here for you, and we'll fight for a brighter future"

Last year when I told my teachers how I was feeling, they showed nothing but compassion. Obviously not all teachers are created equal, but most of them are human just like us and understand mental health difficulties since a lot of them have experienced it themselves. If a teacher isn’t understanding and still thinks of you as a “bad student”, as I’ve been told personally, its just not worth it and I’d highly recommend dropping the class. <3 u dude:) good luck\n\n[3740. Honestly, I was a really good student last year. The lowest grade I would get is around a C or C+...]"

I’m not really ashamed to say that I stalked all their instagrams afterwards lol. \nBut I mostly wanted to say that you guys seem like a super tight knit community of kids with lots of love :) I’m totally jealous and I wish I was involved with theater now even though I’ve never done anything onstage before except play piano, and I’m a terrible actor lol\nAnyway I wanted to tell you guys congrats on a great opening night and everyone onstage (and offstage, shoutout to tech, sound, pit, etc) was really amazing and I hope you guys know you are really awesome people :)"

I write down to do on the top of a piece of paper and then write down activities, chores, or homework on little sticky notes. You take the note off when it’s done, and if it’s not done, leave it for another day or just discard. Putting manageable tasks on the notes help as well... like getting out of bed ✅"

Now some other friends applied to the same school with the same credentials, but most likely got in because they applied for an easier major (such as social science/the arts). I'm not discrediting your accomplishment at all, congratulations, but it just irritates me how you got into a school AND boast in front of your friends who most likely did not get in due to their harder major. Just think about this when talking about your acceptances."

I highly recommend testing it by dropping both Apple AirPod units off a high building (Such as the N-building, although to compensate for the low height of the N-building, it should be dropped multiple times). Apple AirPods are also resistant to large amounts of force, including against a hammer or underneath the wheels of a car."

So much work and love has went into the show, with the actors, crew, pit, and directors doing an amazing job on the show.

    content: "Some schools don't consider choice of major when considering your application – find out what each school's policy is. This second part is pure speculation, but if they're not going to consider your major preference in your application (and you believe them at that), then be as honest as you can about your major choice; the fact that they're still collecting the info means they have a reason, and it could have to do with gagueing interest in a field for guidance on funding/new hires/etc. If you have a major you think you're going to go into, you could end up essentially casting a vote for more attention to that department by listing it as a preference."

It’s so funny to me when people say I’m being “mean” when it’s a fact of the real world that you will never get anywhere if you are pathetically spoiled and self-centered (i.e. the majority of people at Gunn). Stop whining about your “mental health issues” and work hard. I understand if it’s something out of your control like trauma from abuse or an inherited trait, but to all of you with the resources to get through like and make something out of it, just do us all a favor and shut up.

    content: "I mean, for many \"whining\" is literally a therapeutic process. Like venting your problems is a common way of alleviating stress and allowing oneself to keep \"working hard\". There are far more complex factors involved in mental health other than abuse and \"inherited traits\", as if the past Gunn suicides didn't tell you anything.\n\n\"Resources\" is a funny thing to say. Resources are not always accessible, for logistical, social, and psychological reasons. Resources are not always effective. I'm sure even you know this because your opinion is very likely a projection of the trauma and pain you went through. I can see where your bitterness stems from and how others more privileged than you may seem to have more benign problems than you.\n\nBut your view is ultimately fatalistic and self-destructive. A lot of the problems people \"whine\" about cannot be fully expressed with their words. You can never feel what they feel unless you try. And like instead of developing scorn for others, why not empathize and in extension establish some sense of solidarity? That way you can get reciprocal empathy, and we will be better off as a whole."

You have the list, so you know that you don't have to worry about the stuff for that time period(even if it's 10 minutes). And just remember, whatever you have going on will eventually settle down. It will stop eventually. I absolutely promise. You just have to have faith.\n\n2920[I feel like the world is crashing down around me and I can't breathe...]"

    content: "IMO It's what most people should be do. If you can get straight A's at Foothill for $5k/year instead of a University for $60k/year, you will have the better chances at transferring to a top UC/CP. Furthermore, you meet CC professors on a more individual basis and classes are typically about understanding the content, rather than evaluating you. The single good thing about hopping into undergrad is the social life for frats and living in dorms. Otherwise it's a blatant waste of money."

    content: "Okay. I’ll give this a shot.\n\nFirst, according to SparkNotes, the definitive resource for reading assignment procrastination:\n\n“He tells Nick that Daisy was driving when the car struck Myrtle, but that he himself will take the blame.”\n\nNow while SparkNotes provides summaries they also provide insight on certain aspects of novels. If this were a lie, they would mention it. In fact, an example of this insight actually disproves any notion of Gatsby driving the car:\n\n“He[Tom] also assumes that Gatsby was the driver.”\n\nNote the word “assume”. An assumption, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, involves a statement without proof. The statement without proof is the one that describes Gatsby as the driver. The statement with proof is the one that describes Daisy as the driver.\n\nAside from hard evidence via Gatsby himself, proof that Daisy was driving lies in the eyewitness accounts as well. While these accounts do not necessarily mention a woman or Daisy driving specifically, their descriptions are most certainly in line with Gatsby’s.\n\nGatsby’s account is as follows:\n\n“You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and thought it would steady her to drive. And this woman rushed out at us as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly...Anyhow, Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn't, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.”\n\nFrom this we can discern that the incident happened very quickly, the car was moving incredibly fast, and there was a period of time after Myrtle’s death in which Daisy was still driving.\n\nOne eyewitness said that the car hadn’t stopped, and was doing 50-60mph down the road. This is in line with Gatsby’s account.\n\nHowever, it is the newspaper article describing the event that confirms Gatsby’s confession best:\n\n“The \"death car\" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, then disappeared around the next bend.”\n\nNote how it mentions the car “wavering tragically for a moment”. Gatsby’s confession to Nick also mentions this wavering, a specific detail he can’t have known would be printed. \n\nFinally, Gatsby has no reason to drive. Nowhere in the entire novel does a motive for Gatsby to drive the car and murder Myrtle exist. Myrtle has zero meaning in his life. If anything, he may want Tom to choose Myrtle so that Daisy could be his. Plus, let’s not forget that Gatsby is probably  incredibly good at driving considering his history.\n\nAt the end of the day, the simplest answer is probably the right one. In this case, it is that Daisy was driving the car. To claim that Gatsby was driving means jumping through far too many loopholes. The evidence is clear. SparkNotes, Gatsby’s personal account to his most trusted friend, eyewitness accounts, the newspaper article, and logic, all support the fact that Daisy was driving the car."

- content: "2473. One time in my Spanish class we were playing a quizlet live game. My teacher was always like “Try to hack me now, try to hack me now” so I added my friend from Florida under “Big Gay Kris” or something. It went completely undetected somehow\n\nluckily enough he was assigned to my group, but he, a recently graduated senior, apparently didn’t know anything despite having taken like 3 Spanish classes. I thought there wouldn’t be any problems because of that but o o f. So many people knew I did it and the teacher got mad but to this day, about a semester later, nobody has ratted me out thank you guys ❤️"
